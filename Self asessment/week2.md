## **Question 1**

What does the I=PAT equation represent?

**A:** That the overall environmental impact (I) is a function of how many people we are (P), how wealthy we are (A), and the environmental efficiency of our technologies (T).

**R:** Yes, this is correct. The I=PAT equation highlights that environmental impact depends jointly on population size, affluence, and technology, not on a single factor alone.

## **Question 2**

How much should the factor T decrease, in order to compensate for increasing P and A and an already large I?

**A:** It should decrease by a factor 4–20.

**R:** Yes, this is the interval commonly discussed in the literature to offset growth in population and affluence while keeping environmental impacts within limits.

## **Question 3**

The Rebound effect may counterbalance the technological improvements causing consumers to buy even more products.

**A:** True

**R:** Yes, the rebound effect occurs because technological improvements often will reduce the price of the products, making money accessible to buy more of the same product or buy other products. This may cause an increase in environmental impact, or reduce the environmental improvement.

## **Question 4**

The object of assessment in sustainability assessment focuses on the service that the product, system, or technology provides.

**A:** True

**R:** Yes, this is an essential feature and very important if performing comparisons between different ways of providing the service.

## **Question 5**

In the suggestion for a stepwise Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment by Neugebauer et al. there are some suggestion for which indicators should be included at each step. Below are the social indicators. Please order them according to which tier they belong starting with the lowest tier.

**A:**

1. Fair wages
    
2. Health
    
3. Human rights
    

**R:** Fair wage is one of the most applicable indicators considered within SLCA. It also describes perfectly a necessity to fulfil basic needs. Therefore it is the first level indicator

Health has been broadly addressed within SLCA and LCA literature and bynumerous institutions, like WHO or OECD. Therefore, they have considered it a tier 2 indicator.

Human rights are normally expressed by different subtopics, e.g. child labour, forced labour, discrimination and equity and therefore it is a more complex indicator to be considered at level 3.

## **Question 6**

How will environmental sustainability be addressed in this course?

**A:** You will assess impact on climate change through a carbon footprint and relate this result to the absolute boundaries (Earth’s carrying capacity) for climate change.

**R:** Yes, climate change is the most commonly known impact and is the subject of concern for most companies. Therefore, the focus of this course is on climate change.

---

## **Question 7**

Fill in the sustainability dimensions.

**A:**

- The environmental aspects is represented by LCA or life cycle assessment
- The economic aspect is represented by LCC or life cycle costing
- The social aspects is represented by SLCA or social life cycle assessment
    

**R:** This corresponds to the triple bottom line framework.

## **Question 8**

The functional unit quantifies the product/system/technology e.g. in terms of it's efficiency, for example as kg CO2 emitted/km driven for a car?

**A:** False

**R:** Correct, the functional unit is a quantification of the service provided by the product/system/technology. In the case of a car it could e.g. be 1 person transported 1 km every day for 10 years.  It does not represent a relative value that includes the CO2 emitted.
