# MC Exam Notes – Nr. 7

## Planetary Boundaries, Circular Economy, and Integrated Sustainability Thinking (MC-Optimized)

This section tests **system-level understanding** and is designed to catch overconfident but shallow answers. Most wrong options sound “green” but are false.

---

## 1. Planetary Boundaries – Core Concept

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Planetary boundaries define a **safe operating space for humanity**
- They concern **Earth-system processes**
- Crossing a boundary:
  - increases risk
  - does **not** imply instant collapse

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Planetary boundaries are economic thresholds
- Boundaries are exact tipping points
- Crossing a boundary guarantees collapse

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option says:

- “risk-based limits” → ✔️
- “hard physical cutoff” → ❌

---

## 2. Holocene vs Anthropocene

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Holocene:
  - stable climate
  - enabled agriculture and civilization
- Anthropocene:
  - human activity dominates Earth systems
  - rapid environmental change

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Humans had no influence in the Holocene
- Anthropocene refers only to climate change

---

## 3. Planetary Boundary Processes (Must Recognize)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Planetary boundaries include **biophysical processes**, such as:

- climate change
- biosphere integrity (biodiversity)
- land-system change
- freshwater use
- nitrogen & phosphorus cycles
- ocean acidification
- ozone depletion
- novel entities

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- GDP growth is a planetary boundary
- Income inequality is a planetary boundary
- Energy prices are planetary boundaries

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If it’s **not an Earth-system process** → ❌

---

## 4. Current Boundary Status (Direction Matters)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Several boundaries are already transgressed
- Biodiversity loss is **severely exceeded**
- Biogeochemical flows are **severely exceeded**
- Climate change is approaching or entering high-risk zones

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- All boundaries are safely within limits
- Climate change is the only exceeded boundary

---

## 5. Earth Overshoot Day

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Marks when annual resource use exceeds regeneration
- Earlier date → higher unsustainability
- Later date → lower pressure

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Overshoot Day is a precise scientific metric
- Overshoot Day measures emissions directly

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“Overshoot Day gives exact planetary limits” → ❌

Correct:

> It is a **communication indicator**

---

## 6. Planetary Boundaries vs LCA

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- LCA is **relative**
- Planetary boundaries provide **absolute context**
- Boundaries help answer:

> “Is this impact acceptable at a global scale?”

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- LCA alone defines sustainability
- Planetary boundaries replace LCA

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

Relative comparison → LCA

Absolute limits → planetary boundaries

---

## 7. Circular Economy – Core Purpose

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Circular economy aims to:

- reduce resource extraction
- reduce waste
- retain value longer

Contrasts with:

> take → make → dispose

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Circular economy eliminates all environmental impact
- Circular economy guarantees sustainability

---

## 8. Bocken Circular Economy Strategies

### ✅ MUST-RECOGNIZE CATEGORIES

**Slowing loops**

- longer lifetime
- repair, maintenance

**Narrowing loops**

- efficiency
- fewer materials per service

**Closing loops**

- recycling
- remanufacturing

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Recycling is always best
- Closing loops dominates all strategies

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option ranks:

- slowing > narrowing > closing → ✔️

---

## 9. Circular Economy Ranking (Very Common MC Topic)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

From sustainability perspective:

1. Slowing
2. Narrowing
3. Closing

Reason:

- recycling is energy-intensive
- material losses occur

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Recycling is the most sustainable option in all cases

---

## 10. Circular Economy Exam Traps

### ❌ ALWAYS FALSE

- “Recycling always reduces impact”
- “Circular economy automatically leads to sustainability”

---

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Circular strategies must be evaluated with **LCA**
- Rebound effects can offset gains
- Impacts can be shifted, not reduced

---

## 11. Circular Economy & Rebound Effects

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Efficiency reduces cost per service
- Lower cost can increase consumption
- Net impact may increase

This links to:

$$ I = P \cdot A \cdot T $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Efficiency guarantees lower total impact

---

## 12. Integrating Sustainability Dimensions

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

True sustainability integrates:

- environmental (LCA, carbon footprint)
- economic (LCC, CBA, IO)
- social (DALYs, S-LCA)

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- One indicator is sufficient
- One dimension dominates sustainability

---

## 13. Absolute vs Relative Sustainability

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Relative:
  - compares options
  - “A is better than B”
- Absolute:
  - compares to planetary limits

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Relative improvement guarantees absolute sustainability

---

## 14. Governance & Policy

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Planetary boundaries cannot be respected by individuals alone
- Require:
  - regulation
  - incentives
  - international cooperation
- Common goods require governance

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Markets alone solve boundary problems
- Awareness alone ensures sustainability

---

## 15. Early Warning Signals for State Shifts

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

As a system approaches a critical transition (state shift), common “early warning signals” include:

- increasing variance in observed variables
- increasing autocorrelation (critical slowing down)

### 🧠 MC ANSWER (Typical Wording)

If the options include these statements, the correct one is:

- ✔️ The variance of values for observable parameters increases

---

## 🔍 MC QUICK ELIMINATION RULES (Nr. 7)

Eliminate options that:

- treat boundaries as economic limits
- treat recycling as universally best
- ignore rebound effects
- claim sustainability can be optimized
- rely on single metrics

---

## ✅ FINAL COURSE-LEVEL MC TAKEAWAY

- Boundaries = absolute limits
- LCA = relative comparison
- Circular ≠ sustainable by default
- Integration is mandatory
- Trade-offs are unavoidable
- Governance is essential
