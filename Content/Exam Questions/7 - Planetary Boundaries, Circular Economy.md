# MC Exam Notes – Nr. 7

## Planetary Boundaries, Circular Economy, and Integrated Sustainability Thinking (MC-Optimized)

This section tests **system-level understanding** and is designed to catch overconfident but shallow answers. Most wrong options sound “green” but are false.

---

## 1. Planetary Boundaries – Core Concept

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Planetary boundaries define a **safe operating space for humanity**
- They concern **Earth-system processes**
- Crossing a boundary:
  - increases risk
  - does **not** imply instant collapse

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Planetary boundaries are economic thresholds
- Boundaries are exact tipping points
- Crossing a boundary guarantees collapse

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option says:

- “risk-based limits” → ✔️
- “hard physical cutoff” → ❌

---

## 2. Holocene vs Anthropocene

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Holocene:
  - stable climate
  - enabled agriculture and civilization
- Anthropocene:
  - human activity dominates Earth systems
  - rapid environmental change

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Humans had no influence in the Holocene
- Anthropocene refers only to climate change

---

## 3. Sustainability Transition (Definition)

### 🧠 MC QUESTION

What does **sustainability transition** mean?

Choose one answer

- interventions so that  acceptable outcomes on the three dimensions of sustainability are sustained and unacceptable conditions are changed towards more sustainable outcomes
- a revolutionary approach to change the way societies work
- a democratic approach to change the way societies work
- utopic scenario where the planet is moved away from planetary boundaries

### ✅ CORRECT ANSWER

- ✔️ interventions so that  acceptable outcomes on the three dimensions of sustainability are sustained and unacceptable conditions are changed towards more sustainable outcomes

### WHY EACH OPTION IS RIGHT/WRONG

- **“Interventions…acceptable outcomes sustained…unacceptable conditions changed”** → **Correct**
  - Sustainability transitions are about **directed change** in socio-technical systems to improve outcomes across **environmental, economic, and social** dimensions.

- **“A revolutionary approach…”** → **Wrong (too narrow)**
  - Transitions can include **incremental + structural** change; “revolutionary” is not required.

- **“A democratic approach…”** → **Wrong (not the definition)**
  - Participation/governance can matter, but “democratic” is not what defines a transition.

- **“Utopic scenario…”** → **Wrong**
  - Transitions are not utopias; they are **real-world pathways** toward staying within limits (e.g., planetary boundaries), not “moving the planet away” from them.

---

## 4. Planetary Boundary Processes (Must Recognize)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Planetary boundaries include **biophysical Earth-system processes** with (proposed) **control variables** used to track whether we are inside/outside the safe operating space.

Concrete list: the **9 planetary boundaries** and what each entails:

1. **Climate change** → disruption of Earth’s energy balance from greenhouse gases (often tracked via CO₂ concentration / radiative forcing).
2. **Biosphere integrity** → loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, reducing resilience of ecosystems.
3. **Land-system change** → conversion of natural land (e.g., forests) to cropland/urban land, altering carbon storage, water cycles, and habitats.
4. **Freshwater change** → human alteration of freshwater quantity/flows (withdrawals, dams, flow modification) that disrupts ecosystems and regional climate.
5. **Biogeochemical flows (nitrogen & phosphorus)** → excess N/P from fertilizers and waste causing eutrophication and dead zones.
6. **Ocean acidification** → declining ocean pH from CO₂ uptake, harming calcifying organisms and marine food webs.
7. **Stratospheric ozone depletion** → thinning of the ozone layer, increasing harmful UV radiation.
8. **Atmospheric aerosol loading** → particles/air pollution affecting climate (radiation/clouds) and regional rainfall/monsoons.
9. **Novel entities** → synthetic substances (e.g., plastics, PFAS, toxic chemicals) accumulating beyond safe assimilation capacity.

Important nuance:

- Some boundaries are **global** (e.g., climate), while others are **strongly regional** (e.g., freshwater, aerosols). “Global average” thinking can be misleading.

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- GDP growth is a planetary boundary
- Income inequality is a planetary boundary
- Energy prices are planetary boundaries

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If it’s **not an Earth-system process** → ❌

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAPS

- Confusing **planetary boundaries** with **social/economic indicators** (GDP, prices, inequality) → ❌
- Treating boundaries as **exact tipping points** rather than **risk-based limits** → ❌
- Thinking boundaries are “impacts like CO₂ footprint” rather than **underlying Earth-system processes** → ❌

---

## 5. Current Boundary Status (Direction Matters)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Several boundaries are already transgressed
- Biodiversity loss is **severely exceeded**
- Biogeochemical flows are **severely exceeded**
- Climate change is approaching or entering high-risk zones

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- All boundaries are safely within limits
- Climate change is the only exceeded boundary

---

## 6. Earth Overshoot Day

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Marks when annual resource use exceeds regeneration
- Earlier date → higher unsustainability
- Later date → lower pressure

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Overshoot Day is a precise scientific metric
- Overshoot Day measures emissions directly

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“Overshoot Day gives exact planetary limits” → ❌

Correct:

> It is a **communication indicator**

---

## 7. Planetary Boundaries vs LCA

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- LCA is **relative**
- Planetary boundaries provide **absolute context**
- Boundaries help answer:

> “Is this impact acceptable at a global scale?”

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- LCA alone defines sustainability
- Planetary boundaries replace LCA

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

Relative comparison → LCA

Absolute limits → planetary boundaries

---

## 8. Circular Economy – Core Purpose

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Circular economy aims to:

- reduce resource extraction
- reduce waste
- retain value longer

Contrasts with:

> take → make → dispose

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Circular economy eliminates all environmental impact
- Circular economy guarantees sustainability

---

## 9. Bocken Circular Economy Strategies

### ✅ MUST-RECOGNIZE CATEGORIES

**Slowing loops**

- longer lifetime
- repair, maintenance

**Narrowing loops**

- efficiency
- fewer materials per service

**Closing loops**

- recycling
- remanufacturing

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Recycling is always best
- Closing loops dominates all strategies

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option ranks:

- slowing > narrowing > closing → ✔️

---

## 10. Circular Economy Ranking (Very Common MC Topic)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

From sustainability perspective:

1. Slowing
2. Narrowing
3. Closing

Reason:

- recycling is energy-intensive
- material losses occur

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Recycling is the most sustainable option in all cases

---

## 11. Circular Economy Exam Traps

### ❌ ALWAYS FALSE

- “Recycling always reduces impact”
- “Circular economy automatically leads to sustainability”

---

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Circular strategies must be evaluated with **LCA**
- Rebound effects can offset gains
- Impacts can be shifted, not reduced

---

## 10A. Design Approaches for Product Longevity (Circular Design)

### ✅ KEY IDEA

**Product longevity** focuses on **slowing loops** (keeping products in use longer). Many circular strategies exist, but **not all are longevity-focused**.

### 🧠 MC QUESTION

Which of the following are **NOT** circular design approaches to **product longevity**?

- Design for emotional durability
- Design for physical durability
- Design for upgrade
- Design for recycling

### ✅ CORRECT ANSWER

- ✔️ **Design for recycling**

Reason: it primarily supports **end-of-life material recovery** (closing loops), not **keeping the product in use longer**.

### WHY EACH OPTION IS RIGHT/WRONG

- **Design for emotional durability** → **Longevity-focused (NOT the answer)**
  - Goal: users keep a product longer because of attachment, satisfaction, identity, or timeless aesthetics.
  - Effect: reduces premature replacement even when the product still functions.

- **Design for physical durability** → **Longevity-focused (NOT the answer)**
  - Goal: robust materials/components, reliability, resistance to wear and failure.
  - Effect: extends technical lifetime and reduces need for replacement.

- **Design for upgrade** → **Longevity-focused (NOT the answer)**
  - Goal: modularity/replaceable components (e.g., battery, memory, key modules) so performance can improve over time.
  - Effect: avoids replacing the whole product when only one part becomes obsolete.

- **Design for recycling** → **Not a longevity design approach (the answer)**
  - Goal: easier disassembly and material separation at end-of-life.
  - Effect: improves material recovery **after** use; does not necessarily extend the use phase.

## 12. Circular Economy & Rebound Effects

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Efficiency reduces cost per service
- Lower cost can increase consumption
- Net impact may increase

This links to:

$$ I = P \cdot A \cdot T $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Efficiency guarantees lower total impact

---

## 13. Integrating Sustainability Dimensions

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

True sustainability integrates:

- environmental (LCA, carbon footprint)
- economic (LCC, CBA, IO)
- social (DALYs, S-LCA)

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- One indicator is sufficient
- One dimension dominates sustainability

---

## 14. Absolute vs Relative Sustainability

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Relative:
  - compares options
  - “A is better than B”
- Absolute:
  - compares to planetary limits

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Relative improvement guarantees absolute sustainability

---

## 15. Governance & Policy

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Planetary boundaries cannot be respected by individuals alone
- Require:
  - regulation
  - incentives
  - international cooperation
- Common goods require governance

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Markets alone solve boundary problems
- Awareness alone ensures sustainability

---

## 16. Early Warning Signals for State Shifts

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

As a system approaches a critical transition (state shift), common “early warning signals” include:

- increasing variance in observed variables
- increasing autocorrelation (critical slowing down)

### 🧠 MC ANSWER (Typical Wording)

If the options include these statements, the correct one is:

- ✔️ The variance of values for observable parameters increases

---

## 17. Value Recovery at Material Level (Circular Economy)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- **Reuse** is primarily **product/component-level** value retention (you keep the item in use).
- **Recycling / recovery** are **material-level** strategies (you break down to material or recover energy/value from material).
- **Cascading** typically means using a material in successive, lower-grade applications (still a *material-use* strategy, not simple reuse of the same product).

### 🧠 MC ANSWER (Typical Wording)

Question: “Which strategy does **NOT** entail value recovery at a **material level**?”

- ✔️ Reuse

---

## 18. Usual (Linear) Value Chain vs Circular Value Chain

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

A **usual (linear) value chain** describes how value is created when products move *one-way* through the economy:

> extract → process → manufacture → distribute → use → dispose

Typical stakeholders in a **linear** value chain include:

- **Materials providers** (extract/process raw materials)
- **Component manufacturers** (make parts/subassemblies)
- **Product manufacturers / assemblers** (final product)
- **Logistics providers** (transport, warehousing, distribution)
- **Retailers / customers** (purchase and use)

Key difference:

- **Circular** value chains add **reverse flows** (collection, sorting, refurbish, remanufacture, recycle) to retain value.

### 🧠 MC QUESTION

Which of the following stakeholders are usually **NOT** present in a **linear** value chain?

Choose one answer

- Logistic Providers
- Component Manufacturers
- Materials Providers
- Value Recovery companies

### ✅ CORRECT ANSWER

- ✔️ Value Recovery companies

### WHY EACH OPTION IS RIGHT/WRONG

- **“Logistic Providers”** → **Usually present**
  - Linear chains still require transport/distribution.

- **“Component Manufacturers”** → **Usually present**
  - Linear production often involves multi-tier supply chains.

- **“Materials Providers”** → **Usually present**
  - Linear chains start with extraction/processing of materials.

- **“Value Recovery companies”** → **Usually NOT present (linear)**
  - Value recovery (collection, refurbish/remanufacture, recycling) is characteristic of **circular/reverse** supply chains, not “take–make–dispose”.

## 19. Interpretation, Trade-offs, and MCDA (Common Exam Traps)

### 🧠 MC QUESTION

Which of the following statements are correct?

Choose one answer

- There are seldomly trade-offs between indicators and or sustainability dimensions
- The interpretation must always include a quantitative uncertainty assessment of the parameters in order to be able to run a monte carlo simulation
- MDCA methods can be used for making a fully objective choice
- The interpretation of the assessment involves an evaluation of the completeness (how well is the system covered).

### ✅ CORRECT ANSWER

- ✔️ The interpretation of the assessment involves an evaluation of the completeness (how well is the system covered).

### WHY EACH OPTION IS RIGHT/WRONG

- **“There are seldomly trade-offs…”** → **Wrong**
  - Trade-offs are **common**, especially when combining environmental, economic, and social indicators.

- **“Interpretation must always include quantitative uncertainty…Monte Carlo”** → **Wrong**
  - Uncertainty/sensitivity analysis is good practice, but it is **not always mandatory**, and it does not have to be Monte Carlo.

- **“MDCA methods can be used for making a fully objective choice”** → **Wrong**
  - (Usually written **MCDA**.) MCDA requires **value judgments** (weights, preferences, normalization), so results are not “fully objective”.

- **“Interpretation involves evaluation of completeness…”** → **Correct**
  - Interpretation includes checking whether the assessment is **complete/consistent** enough to support the conclusions.
