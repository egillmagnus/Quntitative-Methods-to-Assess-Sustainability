# Exam Solutions – Part 3

## LCA, LCC, MFA, IO, EEIO, and CBA – How to Choose the Right Tool

This section explains not only *what* each tool is, but *when* and *why* it is the correct tool to use. Exams frequently test this by giving a scenario and asking which method should be applied.

---

## 1. First: How to Recognize the Question Type

Before answering, always ask:

1. Is the question about **environmental impact**?  
2. Is it about **economic cost**?  
3. Is it about **society-wide effects**?  
4. Is it about **one product** or **the whole economy**?  
5. Is it about **comparison** or **absolute totals**?

Your tool choice must match these dimensions.

---

## 2. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

### What LCA Is Designed to Do

LCA assesses the **environmental impacts** of a product or service across its **entire life cycle**, from:

- raw material extraction  
- manufacturing  
- transport  
- use  
- end-of-life

LCA is always **functional-unit based**.

---

### What LCA Can Answer

LCA is the correct tool when the question asks:

- “Which option has lower environmental impact?”  
- “Where in the life cycle are the hotspots?”  
- “Does use or manufacturing dominate?”  
- “How does changing the electricity mix affect impact?”

---

### What LCA Cannot Answer (Exam Trap)

LCA:

- does **not** give costs  
- does **not** give profits  
- does **not** measure social welfare  
- does **not** give absolute sustainability

If a question asks for **cost**, LCA alone is wrong.

---

### How to Write a Full-Credit LCA Answer

A strong exam answer mentions:

- functional unit  
- system boundaries  
- comparison of alternatives  
- multiple impact categories

---

## 3. Life Cycle Costing (LCC / LCCA)

### What LCC Is Designed to Do

LCC assesses the **total cost** of a product over its **entire life cycle**. It includes:

- purchase cost  
- operating cost  
- maintenance  
- energy  
- disposal  
- residual value

---

### What LCC Can Answer

Use LCC when the question asks:

- “Which option is cheaper over its lifetime?”  
- “How do upfront and operating costs compare?”  
- “Does higher purchase price pay off?”

---

### Critical Exam Insight

LCC focuses on:

- **private costs**, not societal costs

Externalities (e.g. climate damage) are:

- **not included**, unless explicitly stated

This distinction is frequently tested.

---

## 4. LCA vs LCC (Very Common Exam Comparison)

| Aspect          | LCA            | LCC            |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Domain          | Environmental  | Economic       |
| Unit            | Functional unit| Monetary       |
| Costs included  | No             | Yes            |
| Emissions       | Yes            | No             |
| Externalities   | No             | Usually no     |

Correct answers explicitly mention this difference.

---

## 5. Material Flow Analysis (MFA)

### What MFA Is Designed to Do

MFA quantifies:

- material inputs  
- outputs  
- stocks within a **defined system**, usually at a **snapshot in time**.

It is mass-based, not impact-based.

---

### What MFA Can Answer

MFA is correct when the question asks:

- “How much material is used?”  
- “Where do materials accumulate?”  
- “What are the major material flows?”

---

### Common Exam Trap

❌ Incorrect:

> “MFA tells us environmental impact”

✅ Correct:

> MFA tells us **quantities of materials**, not impacts

Impacts require LCA.

---

## 6. Input–Output (IO) Models

### What IO Models Are Designed to Do

IO models describe **interdependencies between economic sectors**. They capture:

- direct effects  
- indirect effects across the whole economy.

---

### What IO Models Can Answer

Use IO models when the question asks:

- “What is the total economic impact of an activity?”  
- “How many jobs are created indirectly?”  
- “What sectors are affected by increased demand?”

---

### Important Concept: Multipliers

IO models compute **multipliers**, meaning:

- one unit of demand creates more than one unit of total activity

Mentioning multipliers shows understanding.

---

## 7. Environmentally Extended IO (EEIO)

### What EEIO Adds

EEIO combines:

- IO tables (money flows)  
- environmental data (emissions)

This allows estimation of:

- indirect environmental impacts of consumption

---

### When EEIO Is Correct

Use EEIO when:

- supply chains are global  
- product-level LCA data is unavailable  
- economy-wide impacts are needed

---

### Key Limitation (Exam Relevant)

EEIO:

- uses **sector averages**  
- has **low resolution**  
- is less precise than LCA for specific products

---

## 8. Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA)

### What CBA Is Designed to Do

CBA compares:

- total benefits  
- total costs expressed in **monetary terms**.

Environmental and social impacts are monetized.

---

### When CBA Is the Right Tool

Use CBA when:

- deciding whether a project should be undertaken  
- comparing alternatives with different benefits  
- evaluating public investments

---

### Critical Exam Insight

CBA depends heavily on:

- assumptions  
- discount rates  
- valuation of non-market impacts

Mentioning uncertainty strengthens answers.

---

## 9. Combining Tools (Very High-Value Exam Insight)

No single tool is sufficient. Typical combinations:

- LCA + LCC → environmental + economic  
- LCA + DALYs → environment + health  
- IO + EEIO → economy + environment  
- LCA + CBA → environmental + monetary

Exams reward recognizing **complementarity**.

---

## 10. How to Choose the Right Tool (Exam Checklist)

Ask:

1. Environmental impact? → LCA  
2. Cost over lifetime? → LCC  
3. Material quantities? → MFA  
4. Economy-wide effects? → IO  
5. Environmental + economy-wide? → EEIO  
6. Monetized comparison? → CBA

---

## Summary: What You Must Know for Full Credit

- Tools answer **different questions**  
- Misusing a tool costs points  
- Naming limitations earns points  
- Combining tools earns top marks  
- Always align the tool with the question
