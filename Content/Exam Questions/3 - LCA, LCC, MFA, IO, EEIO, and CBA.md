# MC Exam Notes – Nr. 3

## LCA, LCC, MFA, IO, EEIO, and CBA (Multiple Choice Optimized)

This section is about **tool recognition**. In MC exams, most wrong answers come from **using the right tool for the wrong question**.

---

## 1. First Rule: Identify What the Question Is Asking

### 🧠 FAST TOOL CHECK

Ask yourself:

- Environmental impact? → LCA
- Cost over lifetime? → LCC
- Material quantities? → MFA
- Economy-wide effects? → IO
- Economy-wide + environment? → EEIO
- Monetized decision? → CBA

If an option uses the wrong tool for the question → ❌

---

## 2. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Assesses **environmental impacts**
- Covers **entire life cycle**
- Is **functional-unit based**
- Compares **services**, not products
- Can identify **hotspots**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- LCA gives costs or profits
- LCA measures social welfare
- LCA provides absolute sustainability
- LCA ignores system boundaries

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAPS

- “LCA tells us if a product is sustainable” → ❌
- “LCA includes prices or costs” → ❌

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If the option mentions:

- CO₂, impacts, hotspots → ✔️ LCA
- cost, money → ❌ not LCA

---

## 3. Life Cycle Costing (LCC / LCCA)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Includes **CAPEX + OPEX** ( CAPITAL EXPENCES  + OPERATIONAL EXPENCES)
- Covers **entire lifetime**
- Uses **monetary units**
- Can include maintenance and residual value

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- LCC measures emissions
- LCC includes external environmental damage (unless stated)
- LCC ignores upfront costs

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAPS

- “LCC only includes operating costs” → ❌
- “LCC includes climate damage costs” → ❌

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- lifetime cost → ✔️ LCC
- environmental impact → ❌ not LCC

---

## 4. LCA vs LCC (Very Common MC Comparison)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- LCA → environmental
- LCC → economic
- Same product can score:
  - worse in LCA
  - better in LCC (or vice versa)

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- LCA and LCC answer the same question
- One can replace the other

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mixes:

- emissions + cost → ❌ unless **combined explicitly**

---

## 5. Material Flow Analysis (MFA)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Quantifies **materials**
- Uses **mass units**
- Tracks **inputs, outputs, stocks**
- Often a **snapshot in time**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- MFA gives environmental impact
- MFA gives costs
- MFA includes toxicity or health effects

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“MFA tells us which option is environmentally best” → ❌

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- tons, kg, flows → ✔️ MFA
- emissions or damage → ❌ not MFA

---

## 6. Input–Output (IO) Models

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Economy-wide
- Sector-based
- Captures **direct + indirect effects**
- Uses **monetary flows**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- IO is product-specific
- IO uses functional units
- IO ignores indirect effects

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“IO is precise for individual products” → ❌

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- sectors, economy-wide, jobs → ✔️ IO

---

## 7. Environmentally Extended IO (EEIO)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- IO + environmental data
- Captures **indirect emissions**
- Useful for **global supply chains**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- EEIO is high-resolution
- EEIO replaces product-level LCA
- EEIO gives exact product impacts

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“EEIO is more accurate than LCA for products” → ❌

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- consumption footprint
- indirect emissions → ✔️ EEIO

---

## 8. Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Compares **costs and benefits**
- Expressed in **monetary terms**
- Can include environmental impacts **if monetized**
- Used for **decision-making**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- CBA avoids assumptions
- CBA is objective or exact
- CBA ignores discounting

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“CBA gives a scientifically correct answer” → ❌

Correct logic:

> CBA depends on assumptions and valuation

---

## 9. Combining Tools (High-Value MC Insight)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- No single tool is sufficient
- Tools are **complementary**
- Combined use improves decision quality

Examples:

- LCA + LCC
- LCA + DALYs
- EEIO + CBA

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- One tool captures full sustainability
- Combining tools is redundant

---

## 🔍 MC QUICK ELIMINATION RULES (Nr. 3)

Eliminate options that:

- use cost tools for environmental questions
- use LCA for cost questions
- claim absolute sustainability
- ignore indirect effects when economy-wide impacts are asked
- treat MFA as an impact method
