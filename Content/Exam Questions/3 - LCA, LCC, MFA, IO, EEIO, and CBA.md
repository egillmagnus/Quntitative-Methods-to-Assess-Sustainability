# MC Exam Notes – Nr. 3

## LCA, LCC, MFA, IO, EEIO, and CBA (Multiple Choice Optimized)

This section is about **tool recognition**. In MC exams, most wrong answers come from **using the right tool for the wrong question**.

---

## 1. First Rule: Identify What the Question Is Asking

### 🧠 FAST TOOL CHECK

Ask yourself:

- Environmental impact? → LCA
- Cost over lifetime? → LCC
- Material quantities? → MFA
- Economy-wide effects? → IO
- Economy-wide + environment? → EEIO
- Monetized decision? → CBA

If an option uses the wrong tool for the question → ❌

---

## 2. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Assesses **environmental impacts**
- Covers **entire life cycle**
- Is **functional-unit based**
- Compares **services**, not products
- Can identify **hotspots**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- LCA gives costs or profits
- LCA measures social welfare
- LCA provides absolute sustainability
- LCA ignores system boundaries

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAPS

- “LCA tells us if a product is sustainable” → ❌
- “LCA includes prices or costs” → ❌

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If the option mentions:

- CO₂, impacts, hotspots → ✔️ LCA
- cost, money → ❌ not LCA

---

## 3. Life Cycle Costing (LCC / LCCA)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Includes **CAPEX + OPEX** ( CAPITAL EXPENCES  + OPERATIONAL EXPENCES)
- Covers **entire lifetime**
- Uses **monetary units**
- Can include maintenance and residual value

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- LCC measures emissions
- LCC includes external environmental damage (unless stated)
- LCC ignores upfront costs

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAPS

- “LCC only includes operating costs” → ❌
- “LCC includes climate damage costs” → ❌

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- lifetime cost → ✔️ LCC
- environmental impact → ❌ not LCC

---

### 🧠 MC QUESTION (Goal & Scope in LCC)

Which of these activities are normally **NOT** part of the **goal and scope** of LCC?

Choose one answer:

- Determine the purpose of LCC analysis
- Select the appropriate model
- Consider the volatility of costs and cost-influencing parameters
- Define the scope of the system

### ✅ CORRECT ANSWER

- ✔️ Consider the volatility of costs and cost-influencing parameters

### WHY EACH OPTION IS RIGHT/WRONG

- **“Determine the purpose of LCC analysis”** → **Part of goal definition**
  - This is exactly what the “goal” step is: *why* you do the LCC and *for whom*.

- **“Select the appropriate model”** → **Typically part of scope/method choice**
  - In goal & scope you choose the general approach (e.g., what type of LCC/LCCA, perspective, and key methodological choices).

- **“Consider the volatility of costs and cost-influencing parameters”** → **Not goal & scope (interpretation/uncertainty)**
  - Volatility/uncertainty is usually handled via **sensitivity/uncertainty analysis** after the model is set up (interpretation).

- **“Define the scope of the system”** → **Part of scope definition**
  - Scope includes what is inside/outside the system (system boundary), time horizon, and cost categories.

---

## 4. LCA vs LCC (Very Common MC Comparison)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- LCA → environmental
- LCC → economic
- Same product can score:
  - worse in LCA
  - better in LCC (or vice versa)

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- LCA and LCC answer the same question
- One can replace the other

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mixes:

- emissions + cost → ❌ unless **combined explicitly**

---

## 5. Material Flow Analysis (MFA)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Quantifies **materials**
- Uses **mass units**
- Tracks **inputs, outputs, stocks**
- Often a **snapshot in time**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- MFA gives environmental impact
- MFA gives costs
- MFA includes toxicity or health effects

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“MFA tells us which option is environmentally best” → ❌

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- tons, kg, flows → ✔️ MFA
- emissions or damage → ❌ not MFA

---

## 6. Input–Output (IO) Models

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Economy-wide
- Sector-based
- Captures **direct + indirect effects**
- Uses **monetary flows**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- IO is product-specific
- IO uses functional units
- IO ignores indirect effects

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“IO is precise for individual products” → ❌

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- sectors, economy-wide, jobs → ✔️ IO

---

## 7. Environmentally Extended IO (EEIO)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- IO + environmental data
- Captures **indirect emissions**
- Useful for **global supply chains**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- EEIO is high-resolution
- EEIO replaces product-level LCA
- EEIO gives exact product impacts

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“EEIO is more accurate than LCA for products” → ❌

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- consumption footprint
- indirect emissions → ✔️ EEIO

---

## 8. Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Compares **costs and benefits**
- Expressed in **monetary terms**
- Can include environmental impacts **if monetized**
- Used for **decision-making**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- CBA avoids assumptions
- CBA is objective or exact
- CBA ignores discounting

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“CBA gives a scientifically correct answer” → ❌

Correct logic:

> CBA depends on assumptions and valuation

---

## 9. Combining Tools (High-Value MC Insight)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- No single tool is sufficient
- Tools are **complementary**
- Combined use improves decision quality

Examples:

- LCA + LCC
- LCA + DALYs
- EEIO + CBA

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- One tool captures full sustainability
- Combining tools is redundant

---

## 10. LCSA Result Visualization (Backes et al.)

### ✅ KEY IDEA

LCSA combines **environmental + economic + social** results, typically as **multiple indicators**. A common visualization pitfall is to **over-aggregate**, which hides what happens within each sustainability dimension.

### 🧠 MC QUESTION

What is the main gap in existing methods for visualizing LCSA results according to Backes et al.?

- They do not sufficiently use both colors and numerical values to ease the interpretation
- They do not present both indicators for each sustainability dimension and an overall assessment of the full LCSA in a comprehensible way
- They only show aggregated results and do not present indicators for each sustainability dimension
- They can only be used for comparisons and not for e.g. optimization of a system

### ✅ CORRECT ANSWER

- ✔️ They only show aggregated results and do not present indicators for each sustainability dimension

### WHY EACH OPTION IS RIGHT/WRONG

- **“Colors + numerical values are missing”** → **Wrong (not the main gap)**
  - This is a *formatting choice*; you can add numbers/colors, but that still doesn’t solve the core problem of **information loss from aggregation**.

- **“Need both per-dimension indicators AND an overall LCSA score”** → **Wrong / overstated**
  - An “overall LCSA” single score is often **not mandatory** (and can be controversial due to weighting/normalization).
  - The key gap highlighted here is specifically that methods **don’t show the dimension-specific indicators** (they collapse them).

- **“Only aggregated results; no indicators per dimension”** → **Correct**
  - Aggregation hides whether a trade-off is driven by environment vs economy vs social.
  - Good visualization should allow interpreting **each dimension’s indicators**, not just a rolled-up result.

- **“Only for comparisons, not optimization”** → **Wrong (not the main gap)**
  - Visualization methods can be used in multiple decision contexts; the bigger limitation is typically **what they show**, not whether the same plot can support optimization.

## 🔍 MC QUICK ELIMINATION RULES (Nr. 3)

Eliminate options that:

- use cost tools for environmental questions
- use LCA for cost questions
- claim absolute sustainability
- ignore indirect effects when economy-wide impacts are asked
- treat MFA as an impact method
