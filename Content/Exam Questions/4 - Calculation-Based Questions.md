# MC Exam Notes – Nr. 4

## Calculation-Based Questions (Vehicles, Coffee, Batteries, Lifetime Reasoning)

This section trains you to **spot the correct answer without heavy calculation**. MC questions test **structure, dominance, and proportional reasoning**.

---

## 1. Functional Unit in Calculation Questions

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Calculations must be normalized to a **functional unit**
- Typical functional units:
  - transport → per km
  - coffee → per cup
  - appliances → per year or lifetime

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Comparing “one product” without lifetime normalization
- Mixing per-use and total values

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If options compare:

- objects → ❌
- services (km, cup, year) → ✔️

---

## 2. Life-Cycle Structure (Universal)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

$$ \text{Total Impact} = \text{Manufacturing} + \text{Use} + \text{End-of-life (if stated)} $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Only manufacturing matters
- Only use phase matters
- End-of-life always dominates

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“Manufacturing dominates for all products” → ❌

Correct:

> Dominant phase depends on **lifetime and energy use**

---

## 3. Use-Phase Impact Logic

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

$$ \text{Use impact} = \text{Energy use} \times \text{Carbon intensity} $$

- Electricity mix directly affects use-phase impact
- Same product → different footprint in different countries

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Use-phase emissions are location-independent
- Energy use alone determines impact

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option ignores **electricity mix** → likely wrong

---

## 4. Lifetime Normalization (Very Common MC Topic)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

$$ \text{Impact per unit} = \frac{\text{Manufacturing impact}}{\text{Lifetime use}} + \text{Use impact per unit} $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Short lifetime has no effect
- Manufacturing impact is independent of lifetime

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“Large battery = always bad” → ❌

Correct:

> Depends on **lifetime km**

---

## 5. Battery Manufacturing Impact

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

$$ \text{Battery impact} = \text{Capacity (kWh)} \times \text{Impact per kWh} $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Battery impact is negligible
- Battery impact depends on electricity mix in use phase

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option scales with:

- battery size → ✔️
- driving location → ❌ (manufacturing)

---

## 6. Vehicles: Car vs EV vs E-Bike

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE (Order of Magnitude)

- E-bike impact per km ≪ car impact per km
- EV manufacturing impact > ICE manufacturing
- EV use-phase impact < ICE use-phase (clean grid)

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- EVs are always worse than ICE cars
- E-bikes are comparable to cars
- Manufacturing dominates EV lifetime impact in all cases

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option says:

- “orders of magnitude” → ✔️
- “always” → ❌

---

## 7. Coffee Questions (Classic MC Topic)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Functional unit = **1 cup of coffee**
- Machine impact is spread over many cups
- Coffee production and energy dominate

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Coffee machine dominates per-cup impact
- One coffee ≈ one commute

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option blames:

- machine → ❌
- coffee beans / energy → ✔️

---

## 8. Comparing Behaviors (Coffee vs Commuting)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Convert to same unit (e.g. per day)
- Compare **orders of magnitude**

Typical result:

- commuting ≫ coffee

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Small daily impacts are irrelevant
- Lifestyle impacts do not accumulate

---

## 9. Proportional Reasoning (No Calculator)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Relative scaling is sufficient
- Ratios matter more than absolute numbers

Example logic:

- 3× energy × ¼ intensity ≈ similar impact

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Exact arithmetic is required unless stated
- Precision determines correctness

---

## 10. Break-Even Analysis

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Break-even occurs when:

$$ \Delta \text{Manufacturing} = \Delta \text{Use} \times \text{Time or Distance} $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Break-even is instantaneous
- Break-even is independent of electricity mix

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- payback time or distance → ✔️
- immediate benefit → ❌

---

## 🔍 MC QUICK ELIMINATION RULES (Nr. 4)

Eliminate options that:

- compare products instead of services
- ignore lifetime
- ignore electricity mix
- claim one phase always dominates
- demand exact calculations without being asked
