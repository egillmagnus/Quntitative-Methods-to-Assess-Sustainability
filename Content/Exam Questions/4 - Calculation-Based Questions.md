# Exam Solutions – Part 4

## Calculation-Based Questions: Vehicles, Coffee, Batteries, and Lifetime Reasoning

This part explains how to correctly approach *quantitative sustainability questions* without needing a calculator-heavy workflow. Exams test **setup, assumptions, and proportional reasoning**, not arithmetic precision.

---

## 1. First: How to Read a Quantitative Exam Question

Before calculating anything, always identify:

1. **Functional unit** (e.g. per km, per cup, per year, per lifetime)  
2. **Life-cycle phases involved**  
   - Manufacturing  
   - Use  
   - End-of-life (often negligible unless stated)  
3. **What is compared**  
   - Two products?  
   - Two behaviors?  
   - Same product in different contexts?

Most errors come from skipping this step.

---

## 2. General Life-Cycle Impact Formula

Almost all calculation questions reduce to:

$$ \text{Total Impact} = \text{Manufacturing Impact} + \text{Use Impact} + \text{End-of-Life Impact} $$

In exams:

- end-of-life is usually **ignored or explicitly stated**  
- focus is on **manufacturing vs use**

---

## 3. Use-Phase Impact Formula (Key Formula)

For energy-using products:

$$ \text{Use Impact} = \text{Energy Use} \times \text{Carbon Intensity} $$

Where:

- Energy use is typically in $\text{kWh}$  
- Carbon intensity is in $\text{kg CO}_2/\text{kWh}$

This formula appears in **every EV, e-bike, and appliance question**.

---

## 4. Lifetime Impact Formula

When a product is used repeatedly:

$$ \text{Lifetime Impact} = \text{Manufacturing Impact} + (\text{Impact per use} \times \text{Number of uses}) $$

This is crucial for:

- coffee machines  
- vehicles  
- batteries

---

## 5. Vehicles: Impact per Kilometer

### Correct Functional Unit

For transport comparisons:

$$ \text{Functional unit} = 1 \text{ km driven} $$

---

### Impact per km Formula

$$ \text{Impact per km} = \frac{\text{Manufacturing Impact}}{\text{Lifetime km}} + \text{Use-phase impact per km} $$

This formula explains why:

- long lifetime → lower manufacturing impact per km  
- clean electricity → lower use-phase impact

---

## 6. Battery Manufacturing Impact (Very Common)

Battery manufacturing impact is often given as:

$$ \text{Battery Impact} = \text{Battery Capacity} \times \text{Impact per kWh} $$

Example structure (numbers vary by exam):

$$ 40 \text{ kWh} \times 150 \frac{\text{kg CO}_2}{\text{kWh}} $$

---

### Battery Impact per km

$$ \text{Battery impact per km} = \frac{\text{Battery Impact}}{\text{Lifetime km}} $$

This explains why:

- larger batteries are worse **unless**  
- they are used over long distances

---

## 7. E-bike vs Car Reasoning (No Calculator Needed)

Typical exam logic:

- Car:  
  - High manufacturing impact  
  - Moderate use impact  
- E-bike:  
  - Very low manufacturing impact  
  - Very low use impact

Even with rough numbers:

$$ \text{Car impact per km} \gg \text{E-bike impact per km} $$

You should explicitly mention:

- orders of magnitude  
- dominance of use vs manufacturing

---

## 8. Coffee Example (Classic Exam Question)

### Functional Unit

Correct functional unit:

$$ 1 \text{ cup of coffee} $$

---

### Life-Cycle Breakdown

Coffee impact typically includes:

- coffee beans production  
- brewing energy  
- machine manufacturing

---

### Coffee Machine Impact per Cup

$$ \text{Machine impact per cup} = \frac{\text{Machine manufacturing impact}}{\text{Number of cups over lifetime}} $$

This explains why:

- machine impact per cup is small  
- energy and coffee production dominate

---

## 9. Comparing Behaviors (Coffee vs Commuting)

A common exam trick is to compare:

- daily coffee consumption  
- daily commuting

Correct reasoning structure:

1. Convert both to:  
   - per day  
   - same unit (e.g. kg CO₂/day)  
2. Compare magnitudes

Typically:

- commuting dominates  
- coffee is non-negligible but smaller

Stating **relative size**, not exact numbers, is sufficient.

---

## 10. Scaling and Proportional Reasoning

Exams often give ratios instead of full data. If:

- Product A uses 3× more energy  
- Electricity is 4× cleaner

Then:

$$ \text{Impact}_A \approx \frac{3}{4} \text{Impact}_B $$

You are expected to reason **qualitatively**, not compute precisely.

---

## 11. Break-Even Analysis (Very Important)

Break-even distance or time occurs when:

$$ \text{Extra manufacturing impact} = \text{Saved use-phase impact} $$

---

### Break-Even Distance Formula

$$ \text{Break-even km} = \frac{\Delta \text{Manufacturing Impact}} {\Delta \text{Use Impact per km}} $$

This explains:

- why EVs need time to “pay back” manufacturing emissions  
- why clean electricity shortens break-even distance

---

## 12. Typical Exam Traps (And How to Avoid Them)

❌ Forgetting lifetime  
❌ Comparing products instead of services  
❌ Ignoring electricity mix  
❌ Mixing per-unit and total values  
❌ Assuming manufacturing always dominates  

✅ Always normalize to functional unit  
✅ Always separate life-cycle phases

---

## 13. What Examiners Look For in Part 4

Full-credit answers:

- define the functional unit  
- write the correct formula  
- explain which term dominates  
- justify assumptions  
- compare orders of magnitude

You do **not** need exact arithmetic unless explicitly asked.

---

## Summary

- Most calculations reduce to a few core formulas  
- Understanding structure matters more than numbers  
- Lifetime normalization is essential  
- Electricity mix is a key driver  
- Break-even reasoning is high-value
