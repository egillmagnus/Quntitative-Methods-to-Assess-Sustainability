# MC Exam Notes – Nr. 5

## Resource Economics, Fisheries, MSY, MEY, and Trade-offs (MC-Optimized)

This section trains you to **recognize correct statements instantly** in fisheries and renewable resource MC questions.

---

## 1. What Kind of Resource Is a Fishery?

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Fisheries are **renewable**
- Fisheries are typically **common-pool resources**
- They are:
  - rivalrous
  - difficult to exclude access to
- Sustainability depends on **management**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Fisheries are non-renewable
- Fisheries are private goods by default
- Renewable means cannot collapse

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If the option mentions:

- shared access + depletion → ✔️ common-pool resource

---

## 2. Biomass Dynamics (Core Structure)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

$$ B_{t+1} = B_t + G(B_t) - H_t $$

- Biomass increases via growth
- Biomass decreases via harvest

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Harvest increases biomass
- Biomass is independent of harvest
- Growth is constant at all biomass levels

---

## 3. Logistic Growth Function

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

$$ G(B) = r B \left(1 - \frac{B}{K}\right) $$

- Growth = 0 at $B=0$
- Growth = 0 at $B=K$
- Growth is maximal at intermediate $B$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Growth is highest at $B=K$
- Growth is linear
- Growth is independent of biomass

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option says:

- “maximum growth at half carrying capacity” → ✔️

---

## 4. Sustainable Harvest Condition

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Harvest is sustainable if:

$$ H \le G(B) $$

- If harvest exceeds growth → collapse

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Any constant harvest is sustainable
- Sustainability depends only on price

---

## 5. Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- MSY is a **biological concept**
- MSY is the **maximum long-term harvest**
- MSY depends on the growth model

---

### ✅ LOGISTIC MODEL FACTS

- MSY occurs at:

$$ B = \frac{K}{2} $$

- MSY value:

$$ \text{MSY} = \frac{rK}{4} $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- MSY is always safe
- MSY guarantees sustainability in practice
- MSY is an economic optimum

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“MSY is conservative” → ❌

Correct:

> MSY is **risky under uncertainty**

---

## 6. Effort, Catch, and CPUE

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

$$ H = qEB $$

- More effort → more harvest (short term)
- CPUE:

$$ \text{CPUE} = \frac{H}{E} = qB $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- CPUE is independent of biomass
- Increasing effort always increases CPUE

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option says:

- “CPUE declines as stock collapses” → ✔️

---

## 7. Why MSY Is Not Enough (Economics)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Biological sustainability ≠ economic sustainability
- Profit matters for fishers

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- MSY maximizes profit
- Economics are irrelevant to sustainability

---

## 8. Maximum Economic Yield (MEY)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- MEY maximizes **profit**
- MEY occurs at **lower effort than MSY**

$$ E_{\text{MEY}} < E_{\text{MSY}} $$

- MEY implies:
  - higher biomass
  - lower ecological risk

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- MEY maximizes catch
- MEY occurs at higher effort than MSY

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option says:

- “lower effort, higher biomass” → ✔️ MEY

---

## 9. Effect of Subsidies

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Subsidies reduce effective costs
- Subsidies increase fishing effort
- Subsidies push fisheries toward overexploitation

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Subsidies improve sustainability
- Subsidies reduce effort

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- subsidies + sustainability → ❌

---

## 10. Bycatch and Biodiversity Constraints

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Bycatch increases with effort

$$ \text{Bycatch} \propto E $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Bycatch is unrelated to fishing effort
- Bycatch only affects target species

---

## 11. Potential Biological Removal (PBR)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- PBR limits acceptable bycatch
- PBR protects vulnerable species
- Sustainability requires:

$$ \text{Bycatch} \le \text{PBR} $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- MSY overrides PBR
- Economic profit justifies exceeding PBR

---

## 12. Multi-Criteria Sustainability

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Sustainable fisheries must satisfy:

- biological constraints (MSY)
- economic viability (MEY)
- biodiversity limits (PBR)

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- One criterion is sufficient
- Sustainability has a single optimum

---

## 13. Tragedy of the Commons (Fisheries Context)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Individual incentives → overfishing
- Nash equilibrium → collapse
- Governance is required

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Awareness alone prevents collapse
- Markets solve common-pool problems automatically

---

## 🔍 MC QUICK ELIMINATION RULES (Nr. 5)

Eliminate options that:

- treat MSY as safe or conservative
- confuse MSY and MEY
- ignore bycatch constraints
- claim subsidies help sustainability
- assume renewable = safe
