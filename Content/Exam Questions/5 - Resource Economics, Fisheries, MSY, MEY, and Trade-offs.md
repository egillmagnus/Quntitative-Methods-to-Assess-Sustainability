# Exam Solutions – Part 5

## Resource Economics, Fisheries, MSY, MEY, and Trade-offs

This part covers renewable resource management using fisheries as the core example. Exams test whether you understand **biological dynamics**, **economic incentives**, and **why sustainability is a trade-off problem**, not a single optimum.

---

## 1. What Type of Sustainability Problem Is a Fishery?

A fishery is:

- a **renewable resource**  
- typically a **common-pool resource**  
- biologically renewable  
- economically rivalrous  
- often non-excludable

This combination makes fisheries **inherently difficult to manage sustainably**.

---

## 2. Stock Dynamics: The Biological Foundation

### Biomass Balance Equation

Fish biomass evolves according to:

$$ B_{t+1} = B_t + G(B_t) - H_t $$

Where:

- $B_t$ = biomass at time $t$  
- $G(B_t)$ = natural growth  
- $H_t$ = harvest

This equation is the **starting point of all fishery models**.

---

## 3. Logistic Growth Function (Must Know)

Natural growth is often modeled as:

$$ G(B) = r B \left(1 - \frac{B}{K} \right) $$

Where:

- $r$ = intrinsic growth rate  
- $K$ = carrying capacity  
- $B$ = biomass

---

### Interpretation (Exam Critical)

- Growth is **zero** at $B = 0$  
- Growth is **zero** at $B = K$  
- Growth is **maximal** at an intermediate biomass

This shape is essential to understanding MSY.

---

## 4. Sustainable Harvest Condition

A harvest is **sustainable** if:

$$ H \leq G(B) $$

If:

- $H > G(B)$ → biomass declines  
- $H = G(B)$ → steady state  
- $H < G(B)$ → biomass increases

This logic is often tested conceptually.

---

## 5. Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)

### Definition

**MSY** is the **largest constant harvest** that can be taken *indefinitely* without collapsing the stock.

---

### MSY Location (Logistic Model)

MSY occurs at:

$$ B = \frac{K}{2} $$

And the value of MSY is:

$$ \text{MSY} = \frac{rK}{4} $$

---

### Interpretation

- MSY is a **biological maximum**  
- Harvesting above MSY leads to collapse  
- MSY depends on **model assumptions**

---

### Exam Trap

❌ “MSY is always safe”  
✅ Correct:

- MSY is risky in practice due to uncertainty in $r$ and $K$  
- Small errors can cause overfishing

Mentioning uncertainty earns points.

---

## 6. Effort, Catch, and CPUE

Harvest is often expressed as:

$$ H = q E B $$

Where:

- $q$ = catchability  
- $E$ = fishing effort  
- $B$ = biomass

---

### Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE)

$$ \text{CPUE} = \frac{H}{E} = qB $$

Interpretation:

- CPUE is a **proxy for biomass**  
- Declining CPUE indicates stock depletion

This is frequently tested.

---

## 7. Why MSY Is Not Enough: Economics

A fishery must also be **economically viable**.

### Profit Function

$$ \Pi(E) = p \cdot H(E) - c \cdot E $$

Where:

- $p$ = price per unit catch  
- $c$ = cost per unit effort

---

## 8. Maximum Economic Yield (MEY)

### Definition

**MEY** is the level of fishing effort that **maximizes profit**, not catch.

---

### Key Relationship

Almost always:

$$ E_{\text{MEY}} < E_{\text{MSY}} $$

Meaning:

- MEY implies **lower effort**  
- Higher biomass  
- Lower ecological risk

---

### Interpretation (Very Important)

MEY is often:

- more sustainable  
- more profitable  
- but politically unpopular (fewer fishers)

This socio-economic aspect matters.

---

## 9. Effect of Subsidies (Classic Exam Topic)

Subsidies:

- reduce effective cost $c$  
- increase optimal effort  
- push fishing closer to or beyond MSY

Thus:

> Subsidies generally **undermine sustainability**

This statement is almost always correct in exams.

---

## 10. Bycatch and Biodiversity Constraints

Fishing affects **non-target species**.

### Bycatch Relationship

$$ \text{Bycatch} \propto E $$

More effort → more bycatch.

---

## 11. Potential Biological Removal (PBR)

### Definition

PBR is the **maximum number of individuals of a protected species** that can be removed without threatening population recovery.

---

### Conceptual Formula

$$ \text{PBR} \propto N \cdot r \cdot F_r $$

Where:

- $N$ = population size  
- $r$ = growth rate  
- $F_r$ = recovery factor

---

### Interpretation

If:

$$ \text{Bycatch} > \text{PBR} $$

Then:

- fishery is **not sustainable**  
- regardless of MSY or MEY

---

## 12. Multi-Criteria Sustainability Problem

A sustainable fishery must satisfy:

- $H \le \text{MSY}$ (biological)  
- $\Pi \ge 0$ (economic)  
- $\text{Bycatch} \le \text{PBR}$ (biodiversity)

This creates a **feasible region**, not a single solution.

---

## 13. Trade-offs and Management Options

Possible responses:

- reduce effort  
- improve selectivity  
- spatial closures  
- gear modification

Each option:

- shifts MSY  
- shifts MEY  
- changes trade-offs

---

## 14. Tragedy of the Commons Revisited

Without governance:

- individual rationality → overfishing  
- Nash equilibrium → collapse

Sustainability requires:

- regulation  
- quotas  
- enforcement  
- cooperation

---

## 15. What Examiners Look For in Part 5

Full-credit answers:

- explain biological growth  
- define MSY and MEY correctly  
- explain why MEY < MSY  
- mention uncertainty  
- include bycatch constraints  
- recognize trade-offs

---

## Summary

- Fisheries are renewable but fragile  
- MSY is a biological concept  
- MEY is an economic concept  
- Subsidies distort incentives  
- Bycatch introduces hard constraints  
- Sustainability requires governance
