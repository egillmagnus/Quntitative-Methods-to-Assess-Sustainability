# Exam Solutions – Part 6

## Social Sustainability, Health Impacts, DALYs, and Lifestyle Assessment

This part focuses on **social sustainability**, with strong emphasis on **health impacts**. Exams test whether you understand:

- what social sustainability measures,  
- how health impacts are quantified,  
- and how to interpret DALYs correctly.

---

## 1. What Is Social Sustainability?

### Correct Definition

Social sustainability concerns the ability of a society to:

- maintain and improve human well-being,  
- ensure equity and fairness,  
- protect health, safety, and rights,  
- both now and for future generations.

It complements:

- environmental sustainability (emissions, resources),  
- economic sustainability (costs, value).

---

## 2. Why Health Is Central to Social Sustainability

Health is:

- a core component of human well-being,  
- measurable across populations,  
- affected by lifestyle, environment, and consumption.

Many sustainability impacts ultimately manifest as **health effects**. Therefore, health metrics are used as **quantitative social indicators**.

---

## 3. Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA)

### Purpose of S-LCA

S-LCA assesses **social and socio-economic impacts** of products and services across their entire life cycle. It complements:

- Environmental LCA  
- Life Cycle Costing (LCC)

---

### What S-LCA Can Answer

Use S-LCA when the question asks:

- “What are the social impacts along the supply chain?”  
- “How does a product affect workers or communities?”  
- “Are there social hotspots in production?”

---

### Important Clarification (Exam Relevant)

S-LCA:

- does **not** decide whether a product should exist,  
- evaluates impacts **given that it exists**.

This distinction is sometimes explicitly tested.

---

## 4. Two Approaches in Social Impact Assessment

### 4.1 Reference Scale (Risk-Based) Approach

- Compares social performance to reference values  
- Often qualitative or semi-quantitative  
- Used for screening and hotspot identification

Example:

- child labor risk by country and sector

---

### 4.2 Impact Pathway Approach

- Traces **cause–effect chains**  
- Links activities → exposures → outcomes  
- Allows quantification of impacts

This approach is used for **health impacts**.

---

## 5. Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)

### Core Definition

DALYs measure the **burden of disease** by capturing:

- premature death,  
- years lived with disability.

They quantify **lost healthy life years**.

---

### Fundamental Formula (Must Know)

$$ \text{DALY} = \text{YLL} + \text{YLD} $$

Where:

- YLL = Years of Life Lost (mortality)  
- YLD = Years Lived with Disability (morbidity)

---

## 6. Years of Life Lost (YLL)

### Definition

YLL measures life years lost due to **premature death**.

---

### Formula

$$ \text{YLL} = N \times L $$

Where:

- $N$ = number of deaths  
- $L$ = remaining life expectancy at age of death

---

### Interpretation

- Death at young age → high YLL  
- Death at old age → lower YLL

This is why childhood diseases score high in DALYs.

---

## 7. Years Lived with Disability (YLD)

### Definition

YLD measures the **non-fatal health burden** of disease or injury.

---

### Formula

$$ \text{YLD} = I \times DW \times D $$

Where:

- $I$ = number of cases  
- $DW$ = disability weight (0 = perfect health, 1 = death)  
- $D$ = duration of condition

---

### Interpretation

- Mild but long-lasting conditions → moderate YLD  
- Severe but short conditions → moderate YLD  
- Severe and long-lasting → high YLD

---

## 8. Example DALY Calculation (Exam Style)

Given:

- death at age 75  
- life expectancy = 90  
- cancer duration = 3 years  
- disability weight = 0.3

YLL:

$$ 90 - 75 = 15 $$

YLD:

$$ 0.3 \times 3 = 0.9 $$

DALY:

$$ 15 + 0.9 = 15.9 $$

You must show **both components** for full credit.

---

## 9. Global Burden of Disease (GBD)

### Purpose of GBD

GBD provides:

- global health statistics,  
- disease and risk factor comparisons,  
- DALY estimates across countries.

It enables **comparability** between different health risks.

---

### Risk Factors vs Causes (Often Tested)

- **Cause**: disease or injury (e.g. stroke)  
- **Risk factor**: modifiable driver (e.g. diet, air pollution)

DALYs can be attributed to **risk factors**.

---

## 10. Why DALYs Are Better Than Death Counts

Death counts:

- ignore age at death,  
- ignore non-fatal suffering.

DALYs:

- account for early death,  
- include disability,  
- capture total health loss.

This is a classic conceptual exam question.

---

## 11. Micro-DALYs and Daily Interpretation

### Why Micro-DALYs Are Used

Individual lifestyle impacts are small. To improve intuition, DALYs are converted to:

- micro-DALYs ($10^{-6}$ DALY),  
- minutes of life lost or gained per day.

---

### Conversion Insight

- One year ≈ 525,600 minutes  
- Small daily effects accumulate over a lifetime

---

## 12. Lifestyle and Consumption Impacts on Health

Health is affected by:

- air pollution (PM₂.₅)  
- climate change  
- diet  
- physical activity  
- chemicals

Each pathway contributes **partially**.

---

## 13. Air Pollution Example (Order of Magnitude)

Estimated life expectancy losses:

- Clean cities: few minutes/day  
- Polluted cities: tens of minutes/day  
- Indoor solid fuel use: highest losses

These numbers are used **comparatively**, not precisely.

---

## 14. Diet and Health (Very Common Exam Topic)

### Dietary Risk Factors

Major contributors to DALYs include:

- low fruit intake  
- low whole grains  
- high sodium  
- low calcium

Note:

- “Eating less meat” is **not automatically** a health benefit  
- Nutritional balance matters

This nuance is often tested.

---

## 15. Physical Activity and METs

### MET Definition

- MET = Metabolic Equivalent of Task  
- Measures energy expenditure of activities

Higher MET-hours per week:

- reduce DALYs,  
- improve health outcomes.

Active transport (cycling, walking) scores highly.

---

## 16. Climate Change and Health

Climate change affects health through:

- heat stress  
- extreme events  
- food insecurity  
- disease spread

Health impacts are:

- delayed,  
- unevenly distributed,  
- often affect vulnerable populations most.

---

## 17. Inequality and Environmental Justice

A key insight:

- Those contributing least to environmental damage  
- often suffer the greatest health impacts

This is central to **social sustainability**.

---

## 18. What Examiners Look For in Part 6

Full-credit answers:

- define DALYs correctly  
- explain YLL and YLD  
- use correct formulas  
- distinguish causes vs risk factors  
- interpret lifestyle impacts qualitatively  
- mention equity and justice

---

## Summary

- Social sustainability focuses on human well-being  
- Health impacts are central and measurable  
- DALYs combine mortality and morbidity  
- GBD enables global comparison  
- Lifestyle and consumption affect health via multiple pathways  
- Equity is a core sustainability concern
