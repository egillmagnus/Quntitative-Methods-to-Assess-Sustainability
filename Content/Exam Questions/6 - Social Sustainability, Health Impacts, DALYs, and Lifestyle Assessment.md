# MC Exam Notes – Nr. 6

## Social Sustainability, Health Impacts, DALYs, and Lifestyle Assessment (MC-Optimized)

This section is **high-yield for MC exams** because many options sound “reasonable” but only one is technically correct.

---

## 1. Social Sustainability – Core Meaning

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Social sustainability focuses on **human well-being**
- Includes:
  - health
  - equity
  - fairness
  - safety
- Complements environmental and economic sustainability

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Social sustainability = only income or GDP
- Social sustainability ignores health
- Social sustainability is subjective only

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- health + equity → ✔️
- only money or emissions → ❌

---

## 2. Why Health Is Central

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Health is:
  - measurable
  - comparable across populations
  - affected by lifestyle & environment
- Many sustainability impacts **manifest as health effects**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Health impacts are negligible
- Health is unrelated to sustainability

---

## 3. Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- S-LCA assesses **social impacts across the life cycle**
- Complements:
  - Environmental LCA
  - LCC
- Focuses on:
  - workers
  - communities
  - society

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- S-LCA measures emissions
- S-LCA replaces LCA
- S-LCA decides whether a product should exist

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“S-LCA evaluates if a product is good or bad” → ❌

Correct:

> It evaluates impacts **given the product exists**

---

## 4. Two Social Impact Approaches

### ✅ REFERENCE SCALE APPROACH

- Risk-based
- Relative comparison
- Often qualitative

Typical keywords:

- “risk”
- “hotspots”
- “screening”

---

### ✅ IMPACT PATHWAY APPROACH

- Cause → exposure → outcome
- Quantitative
- Used for **health impacts**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Reference scale gives health damage
- Impact pathways are purely qualitative

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- DALYs → ✔️ impact pathway
- risk level → ✔️ reference scale

---

## 5. DALYs – What They Measure

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- DALYs measure **lost healthy life years**
- Combine:
  - mortality
  - morbidity

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- DALYs count deaths only
- DALYs measure emissions
- DALYs are economic indicators

---

## 6. DALY Formula (Very High-Yield)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

$$ \text{DALY} = \text{YLL} + \text{YLD} $$

If an option violates this → ❌ immediately.

---

## 7. Years of Life Lost (YLL)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Measures **premature death**
- Depends on **age at death**

$$ \text{YLL} = N \times L $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- YLL ignores age
- YLL counts disability
- Death at young age = low YLL

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

Young death → high YLL

Old death → lower YLL

---

## 8. Years Lived with Disability (YLD)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Measures **non-fatal health burden**
- Depends on:
  - number of cases
  - severity
  - duration

$$ \text{YLD} = I \times DW \times D $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Disability weight can exceed 1
- YLD includes mortality
- Short diseases always dominate YLD

---

## 9. DALYs vs Death Counts

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- DALYs are **better than death counts**
- DALYs account for:
  - early death
  - disability

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Death counts are sufficient
- DALYs and death counts give same ranking

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option compares risks → DALYs preferred ✔️

---

## 10. Global Burden of Disease (GBD)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- GBD provides:
  - DALYs
  - causes of disease
  - risk factors
- Enables global comparison

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- GBD only reports deaths
- GBD ignores risk factors

---

## 11. Causes vs Risk Factors (Classic MC Trap)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Cause = disease (e.g. stroke)
- Risk factor = driver (e.g. diet, air pollution)
- DALYs can be attributed to **risk factors**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Risk factors are diseases
- Causes are modifiable behaviors

---

## 12. Micro-DALYs & Daily Interpretation

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Individual impacts are small
- Expressed as:
  - micro-DALYs
  - minutes of life lost/gained per day

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Small daily impacts are irrelevant
- Lifestyle impacts do not accumulate

---

## 13. Lifestyle Health Impacts

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Health affected by:

- air pollution (PM₂.₅)
- diet
- physical activity
- climate change

Each contributes **partially**.

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- One lifestyle factor dominates everything
- Climate has no health impact

---

## 14. Diet and Health (High-Trap Area)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Major dietary risk factors:

- low fruit
- low whole grains
- high sodium
- low calcium

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- “Eating less meat” is automatically healthy
- One food determines health outcome

---

## 15. Physical Activity & METs

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- MET = energy expenditure indicator
- Higher MET-hours:
  - reduce DALYs
  - improve health

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- MET measures emissions
- Physical activity has no health effect

---

## 16. Climate Change & Health

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Climate change affects health via:
  - heat stress
  - extreme events
  - food security
- Impacts are **unequally distributed**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Climate impacts are evenly distributed
- Climate change affects only environment

---

## 17. Inequality & Environmental Justice

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Those contributing least often suffer most
- Equity is central to social sustainability

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Sustainability impacts are evenly shared

---

## 🔍 MC QUICK ELIMINATION RULES (Nr. 6)

Eliminate options that:

- treat DALYs as emissions or money
- ignore age or disability
- confuse causes and risk factors
- claim small impacts do not matter
- treat health as secondary
