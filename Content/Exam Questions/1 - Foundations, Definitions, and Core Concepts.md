# MC Exam Notes – Nr. 1

## Foundations, Definitions, and Core Concepts (Multiple Choice Optimized)

Use this section to **recognize the correct option instantly** and eliminate traps.

---

## 1. Functional Unit (LCA)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- A functional unit describes a **service**, not a product  
- It is **quantified**  
- It includes **amount and/or time**  
- It is required for **comparability** in LCA

Typical wording:

- “per km”  
- “per cup”  
- “per year”  
- “over lifetime”

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- “One product” is a functional unit  
- Functional unit = object  
- Functional unit ignores lifetime  
- Functional unit is optional in LCA

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAPS

- “One coffee machine”  
- “One car”  
- “One battery”  
- “One washing machine”

If the option **does not mention service or quantity**, it is wrong.

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

Ask:

> *Is this phrased as a service with a quantity or time?*

If no → ❌

---

## 2. Renewable vs Non-Renewable Resources

### ✅ NON-RENEWABLE (Correct Logic)

- Does **not regenerate** on human time scales  
- Finite for practical purposes

Examples:

- Oil  
- Coal  
- Natural gas  
- Minerals

---

### ✅ RENEWABLE (Correct Logic)

- Regenerates through natural processes  
- Regeneration can be **overused**

Examples:

- Fish  
- Forests  
- Water  
- Soil

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Renewable = infinite  
- Renewable resources cannot be depleted  
- Non-renewable resources regenerate fast enough to matter

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“Renewable resources are sustainable by definition” → ❌

Correct logic:

> Sustainability depends on **rate of use vs regeneration**

---

## 3. Public Goods vs Common Goods

### Classification Axes (Must Know)

- **Excludability**  
- **Rivalry**

---

### ✅ PUBLIC GOODS

- ❌ Excludable  
- ❌ Rivalrous

Examples:

- Street lighting  
- Knowledge  
- Clean air (low congestion)

Key phrase:

> One person’s use does NOT reduce availability

---

### ✅ COMMON GOODS (Common-Pool Resources)

- ❌ Excludable  
- ✅ Rivalrous

Examples:

- Fish stocks  
- Groundwater  
- Atmosphere (CO₂ capacity)  
- Grazing land

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Common goods are excludable  
- Public goods are rivalrous  
- Atmosphere is a private good

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If:

- shared  
- hard to exclude  
- gets depleted → **Common good**

---

## 4. Tragedy of the Commons

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Occurs when:

- resource is shared  
- users act in self-interest  
- costs are shared  
- benefits are private

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Caused by lack of knowledge  
- Solved automatically by awareness  
- Only applies to non-renewable resources

---

### 🧠 GAME THEORY RECOGNITION

Correct keywords:

- incentives  
- Nash equilibrium  
- prisoner’s dilemma  
- rational defection

If these appear → this is the correct option.

---

## 5. IPAT Identity (I = P × A × T)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Impact increases with:  
  - population (P)  
  - affluence (A)  
- Technology (T) must decrease to compensate

$$ I = P \cdot A \cdot T $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- IPAT is a precise physical law  
- Technology alone solves sustainability  
- Reducing T guarantees reduced impact

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“Efficiency improvements always reduce impact” → ❌

Correct reasoning:

- **Rebound effects** can offset gains

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option ignores rebound → suspicious

---

## 6. Eco-Efficiency

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Ratio of **value/service** to **environmental impact**  
- Measures *relative efficiency*

$$ \text{Eco-efficiency} = \frac{\text{Value}}{\text{Impact}} $$

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Eco-efficiency guarantees sustainability  
- Eco-efficiency measures absolute impact  
- Higher eco-efficiency always reduces total impact

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“Eco-efficiency ensures sustainability” → ❌

Correct:

> Total impact can still rise

---

## 7. Sustainability ≠ Optimization

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Sustainability involves **trade-offs**  
- No single optimum exists  
- Multiple objectives:  
  - environmental  
  - economic  
  - social

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Sustainability = maximize one metric  
- There is one best sustainable solution  
- Sustainability can be solved by optimization alone

---

## 🔍 MC QUICK ELIMINATION RULES (Nr. 1)

Eliminate options that:

- define things as objects instead of services  
- say “always”, “guarantees”, “automatically”  
- ignore incentives, trade-offs, or rebound effects  
- treat renewable as infinite
