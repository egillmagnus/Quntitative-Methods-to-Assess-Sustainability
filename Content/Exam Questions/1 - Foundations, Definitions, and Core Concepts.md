# Exam Solutions – Part 1

## Foundations, Definitions, and Core Concepts

This section covers fundamental conceptual questions that appear repeatedly in the exams. These questions test *understanding*, not memorization, and are often used to separate good answers from excellent ones.

---

## Question Type 1: What Is a Functional Unit?

### Correct Definition

A **functional unit** is a *quantified description of the service provided* by a product or system, used as the reference for comparison in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). It answers the question:

> What service is delivered, how much of it, and under which conditions?

Formally:

- The functional unit defines **what is compared**  
- It ensures **comparability** between alternatives  
- It is expressed in terms of *function*, not *product*

---

### Correct Example (Coffee Machine)

❌ Incorrect functional unit:

- “One coffee machine”

✅ Correct functional unit:

- “Preparation of 10,000 cups of coffee over 5 years”

**Explanation**:

- Different machines have different lifetimes  
- Different machines use different amounts of energy per cup  
- The service is *coffee*, not *the machine*

---

### Why This Matters in Exams

Examiners want to see that you:

- understand that LCA compares **services**, not objects  
- avoid comparing “one item vs one item” when lifetimes differ

A very common mistake is forgetting the *time or quantity* dimension.

---

## Question Type 2: Renewable vs Non-Renewable Resources

### Correct Definitions

#### Non-Renewable Resource

A resource that **does not regenerate on a time scale relevant to human use**.

Examples:

- Oil  
- Coal  
- Natural gas  
- Minerals

Even if geological regeneration exists, it is irrelevant on human time scales.

---

#### Renewable Resource

A resource that **can regenerate through natural processes** within a time frame compatible with human use.

Examples:

- Fish  
- Forests  
- Water  
- Soil

---

### Critical Exam Point (Often Missed)

Renewable **does NOT mean infinite**. A renewable resource can become:

- depleted,  
- functionally extinct,  
- or unable to regenerate, if the **rate of use exceeds the regeneration rate**.

This distinction is essential for full credit.

---

## Question Type 3: Public Goods vs Common Goods

This is a **classification question**, based on two properties:

- **Excludability**: Can users be prevented from access?  
- **Rivalry**: Does one user reduce availability for others?

---

### Public Goods

- ❌ Excludable: No  
- ❌ Rivalrous: No

Examples:

- Street lighting  
- Knowledge  
- Clean air (in absence of congestion)

Key property:

> One person’s use does not reduce availability for others.

---

### Common Goods (Common-Pool Resources)

- ❌ Excludable: No  
- ✅ Rivalrous: Yes

Examples:

- Fish stocks  
- Groundwater  
- Grazing land  
- Atmosphere (for CO₂ emissions)

---

### Why Common Goods Are a Sustainability Problem

Because they are:

- non-excludable  
- rivalrous

they are prone to **overexploitation**, leading to the:

> **Tragedy of the Commons**

This exact reasoning is expected in exam answers.

---

## Question Type 4: The Tragedy of the Commons

### Correct Explanation

The tragedy of the commons occurs when:

- multiple actors share access to a resource,  
- each actor benefits individually from increased use,  
- the costs of overuse are shared collectively.

This creates incentives for **overuse**, even when everyone understands that collapse is inevitable.

---

### Game-Theoretic Interpretation

The tragedy of the commons resembles a **prisoner’s dilemma**:

- Cooperation is collectively optimal  
- Defection is individually rational  
- The Nash equilibrium is overexploitation

You should explicitly mention **incentives** and **lack of enforceable cooperation** to get full marks.

---

## Question Type 5: I = P × A × T (IPAT)

### Correct Interpretation

The IPAT identity states that environmental impact is driven by:

- **P** – Population  
- **A** – Affluence (consumption per person)  
- **T** – Technology (impact per unit of consumption)

$$ I = P \cdot A \cdot T $$

---

### Correct Exam Interpretation

- Population is increasing globally  
- Affluence is increasing globally  
- Therefore, **T must decrease significantly** to stabilize or reduce impact

---

### Common Exam Trap

❌ Incorrect statement:

> “Technology alone will solve sustainability problems”

✅ Correct reasoning:

- Efficiency gains are often offset by **rebound effects**  
- Consumption increases when efficiency improves  
- Therefore, technology alone is insufficient

Mentioning rebound effects strengthens the answer.

---

## Question Type 6: Eco-Efficiency

### Correct Definition

Eco-efficiency measures the amount of **value delivered per unit of environmental impact**. Conceptually:

$$ \text{Eco-efficiency} = \frac{\text{Value or Service}}{\text{Environmental Impact}} $$

---

### Correct Interpretation

Improving eco-efficiency means:

- delivering the same service with lower impact, or  
- delivering more service with the same impact

---

### Critical Limitation (Often Tested)

Eco-efficiency improvements:

- do **not** guarantee absolute reductions in impact  
- can lead to increased total consumption

This links directly back to IPAT and rebound effects.

---

## Question Type 7: Sustainability Is Not Optimization

### Core Exam Message

Sustainability is **not about maximizing one objective**. Instead, it is about:

- balancing environmental,  
- economic,  
- and social objectives,  
- under constraints.

There is no single “optimal” solution — only **acceptable trade-offs**.

---

## Summary: What Examiners Look For in Part 1

To get full marks, your answers should:

- Use **correct terminology**  
- Define concepts **precisely**  
- Explain *why* something matters  
- Avoid simplistic “green = good” reasoning  
- Explicitly mention trade-offs, incentives, and constraints
