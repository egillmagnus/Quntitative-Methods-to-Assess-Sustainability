# MC Exam Notes – Nr. 2

## Climate Change, Carbon Footprint, and Environmental Indicators (MC-Optimized)

Use this section to **identify the correct choice immediately** and eliminate wrong answers fast.

---

## 1. Carbon Footprint – What It Is

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Carbon footprint measures **greenhouse gas emissions**  
- It is expressed in **CO₂-equivalents**  
- It aggregates multiple gases using **GWP**  
- It applies to products, services, activities, or systems

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Carbon footprint measures temperature increase directly  
- Carbon footprint measures health impacts  
- Carbon footprint measures biodiversity loss  
- Carbon footprint is an absolute sustainability measure

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If the option says:

- emissions → ✔️ possible  
- health, deaths, biodiversity → ❌ wrong

---

## 2. Carbon Footprint Formula

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

$$ \text{Carbon footprint} = \sum_i E_i \cdot \text{GWP}_i $$

Where:

- $E_i$ = emissions of gas $i$  
- $\text{GWP}_i$ = Global Warming Potential

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Carbon footprint uses DALYs  
- Carbon footprint ignores non-CO₂ gases  
- Carbon footprint equals energy use

---

## 3. Global Warming Potential (GWP)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- GWP compares gases to **CO₂**  
- CO₂ has $\text{GWP}_{100} = 1$  
- GWP accounts for:  
  - radiative forcing  
  - atmospheric lifetime

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- GWP is a physical constant  
- GWP is exact  
- GWP measures toxicity or health directly

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“GWP100 is used because it is the most accurate” → ❌

Correct logic:

> GWP100 is a **policy convention**

---

## 4. GWP100 – Why 100 Years?

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Balances short- and long-term effects  
- Enables international comparability  
- Is a **standardized choice**

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- GWP100 is scientifically optimal  
- GWP100 captures all climate effects perfectly

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option says:

- “policy convention” → ✔️  
- “physically exact” → ❌

---

## 5. Typical GWP Orders of Magnitude

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE (Order, not exact numbers)

- CO₂ < CH₄ < N₂O  
- Methane ≫ CO₂  
- Nitrous oxide ≫ methane

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Methane is weaker than CO₂  
- Nitrous oxide is similar to CO₂

---

## 6. Electricity Mix and Carbon Intensity

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Carbon footprint of electricity depends on **electricity mix**  
- Coal-based electricity → high footprint  
- Renewable or nuclear electricity → low footprint

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Electricity has the same footprint everywhere  
- Use-phase emissions are independent of location

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If the question compares **countries or grids**, the answer must mention:

> electricity mix

---

## 7. Manufacturing vs Use Phase

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Dominant phase depends on:

- lifetime  
- energy efficiency  
- electricity mix  
- intensity of use

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Manufacturing always dominates  
- Use phase always dominates  
- One rule applies to all products

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MC TRAP

“EVs are worse because manufacturing emissions are high” → ❌ (incomplete)

Correct logic:

> Manufacturing can be high, but **use phase may dominate over lifetime**

---

## 8. Carbon Footprint vs Health Indicators (DALYs)

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Carbon footprint = **climate pressure**  
- DALYs = **health impact**  
- Carbon footprint does **not** measure health directly

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Carbon footprint is a health indicator  
- Carbon footprint measures deaths or illness

---

### 🧠 FAST CHECK

If option mentions:

- DALYs → health  
- CO₂-eq → climate

---

## 9. DPSIR Framework (Very Common MC Topic)

### DPSIR Chain

- **D**river → activity  
- **P**ressure → emissions  
- **S**tate → environmental condition  
- **I**mpact → damage  
- **R**esponse → action

---

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- Carbon footprint is a **pressure indicator**  
- It is *not* an impact indicator

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Carbon footprint = state  
- Carbon footprint = impact

---

## 10. Unequal Responsibility vs Unequal Impact

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

- High-income regions emit more  
- Low-income regions often suffer more  
- Climate change raises **equity and justice** issues

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Emissions and impacts are evenly distributed  
- Those who emit most suffer most

---

## 11. Why One Indicator Is Not Enough

### ✅ ALWAYS TRUE

Carbon footprint does **not** capture:

- toxicity  
- biodiversity loss  
- resource depletion  
- land use

---

### ❌ NEVER TRUE

- Carbon footprint captures total environmental impact  
- One indicator is sufficient for sustainability

---

## 🔍 MC QUICK ELIMINATION RULES (Nr. 2)

Eliminate options that:

- treat carbon footprint as health or biodiversity  
- claim GWP is exact or physical law  
- ignore electricity mix  
- say one phase always dominates  
- claim one indicator is sufficient
