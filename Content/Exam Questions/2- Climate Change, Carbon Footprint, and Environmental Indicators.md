# Exam Solutions – Part 2

## Climate Change, Carbon Footprint, and Environmental Indicators

This section covers climate-related questions that appear in almost every exam. These questions test whether you understand **what carbon footprint actually measures**, how indicators are used, and how to reason quantitatively without a calculator.

---

## Question Type 1: What Is a Carbon Footprint?

### Correct Definition

A **carbon footprint** is a measure of the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with an activity, product, service, or system, expressed in **CO₂-equivalents**. It aggregates emissions of different greenhouse gases using **Global Warming Potentials (GWP)**.

---

### Correct Formula

$$ \text{Carbon footprint} = \sum_i E_i \cdot \text{GWP}_i $$

Where:

- $E_i$ is the emission of gas $i$  
- $\text{GWP}_i$ is the Global Warming Potential of gas $i$

---

### Key Exam Insight

Carbon footprint is:

- an **emission-based indicator**  
- positioned between **pressure** and **impact**  
- **not** a direct measure of temperature change  
- **not** a health indicator

This distinction is frequently tested.

---

## Question Type 2: Global Warming Potential (GWP)

### Correct Explanation

Different greenhouse gases:

- stay in the atmosphere for different lengths of time  
- absorb different amounts of infrared radiation

To compare them, emissions are converted to CO₂-equivalents using GWP.

---

### Correct Definition

$\text{GWP}_{100}$ measures the **integrated radiative forcing** of a gas over a 100-year time horizon relative to CO₂. CO₂ is defined as:

$$ \text{GWP}_{100}(CO_2) = 1 $$

---

### Typical GWP Values (Order of Magnitude)

- CO₂: $1$  
- CH₄ (methane): $\sim 28$  
- N₂O (nitrous oxide): $\sim 265$

You are **not expected to memorize exact values**, but you should know:

- methane is much stronger than CO₂  
- nitrous oxide is much stronger than methane

---

## Question Type 3: Why Use GWP100?

### Correct Exam Answer

GWP100 is used because:

- it balances short- and long-term effects  
- it is internationally standardized  
- it allows comparability across studies

---

### Common Trap

❌ Incorrect:

> “GWP100 is used because it is the most accurate”

✅ Correct:

> GWP100 is a **policy convention**, not a physical truth

Mentioning this distinction often gives extra credit.

---

## Question Type 4: Electricity Mix and Carbon Intensity

### Correct Concept

The **carbon footprint of electricity** depends on the **electricity mix**.

Typical carbon intensities (order of magnitude):

- Coal: very high  
- Natural gas: lower than coal  
- Wind / solar / hydro: very low  
- Nuclear: very low

---

### Exam-Relevant Comparison

If the same electric device is used in:

- Denmark (renewable-heavy grid)  
- Poland (coal-heavy grid)

Then:

- **use-phase emissions differ strongly**  
- manufacturing emissions stay the same

This logic is used repeatedly in EV and e-bike questions.

---

## Question Type 5: Manufacturing vs Use Phase

### Core Exam Principle

Whether manufacturing or use dominates depends on:

- lifetime  
- energy efficiency  
- electricity mix  
- intensity of use

---

### Correct Reasoning Pattern

- Fossil-based energy → use phase dominates  
- Renewable electricity → manufacturing becomes relatively more important

This is why:

- EVs look worse upfront  
- but better over long lifetimes and clean grids

---

## Question Type 6: Carbon Footprint vs DALYs

### Correct Distinction

| Indicator         | Measures            |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Carbon footprint  | Climate pressure    |
| DALYs             | Human health impact |

Carbon footprint:

- does **not** measure health directly  
- must be translated through impact pathways

DALYs:

- capture mortality and morbidity  
- integrate multiple exposure pathways

---

### Typical Exam Trap

❌ Incorrect:

> “Carbon footprint measures health damage”

✅ Correct:

> Carbon footprint measures emissions; health impacts require additional modeling

---

## Question Type 7: DPSIR Framework

### Correct Explanation

The DPSIR framework structures environmental indicators along a cause–effect chain:

- **D**rivers – human activities (e.g. km driven)  
- **P**ressures – emissions (e.g. CO₂)  
- **S**tate – environmental condition (e.g. radiative forcing)  
- **I**mpact – effects (e.g. temperature rise, health damage)  
- **R**esponse – societal actions

---

### Carbon Footprint Placement

Carbon footprint is:

- a **pressure indicator**  
- sometimes linked to impact, but not an impact itself

Correct classification is frequently tested.

---

## Question Type 8: Unequal Responsibility and Unequal Impact

### Correct Exam Explanation

- High-income regions contribute most emissions  
- Low-income regions often suffer the greatest impacts

This creates:

- climate injustice  
- ethical and political challenges

You should explicitly mention:

- responsibility vs vulnerability  
- global inequity

---

## Question Type 9: Why One Indicator Is Not Enough

### Correct Reasoning

Carbon footprint captures:

- climate change only

It does **not** capture:

- toxicity  
- biodiversity loss  
- resource depletion  
- land use

Using a single indicator risks **problem shifting**. This connects directly to LCA thinking.

---

## Summary: What Examiners Look For in Part 2

To score full points, answers should:

- Correctly define carbon footprint and GWP  
- Distinguish pressure vs impact indicators  
- Explain electricity mix effects  
- Avoid confusing carbon footprint with health metrics  
- Mention uncertainty and conventions  
- Show awareness of global inequity
