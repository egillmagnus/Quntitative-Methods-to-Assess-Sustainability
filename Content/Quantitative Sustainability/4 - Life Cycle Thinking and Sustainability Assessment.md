# Chapter 4 – Life Cycle Thinking and Sustainability Assessment

## 1. Life Cycle Sustainability Approach and the “MECO” Framework

A life cycle sustainability perspective is used to understand how products and systems create impacts across their entire value chain and over time. A simplified conceptual framework used in this course is the **MECO** approach:

- **M**aterials
- **E**nergy
- **C**hemicals
- **O**thers

MECO is used as a simplified way to describe *drivers* of environmental impacts across life cycle stages (e.g., material use relates to resource depletion; energy use relates strongly to climate change).

## 2. The Sustainability Challenge Was Highlighted Early

Already in the early 1970s, sustainability challenges were being formulated in a way that emphasized:

- Population growth and consumption patterns matter for environmental impacts.
- Indirect environmental effects caused by consumption can be larger threats than direct local pollution from production sites.
- System dynamics models (e.g., “limits to growth” thinking) suggested that continued global growth could lead to system collapse in many scenarios, while imposing limits could enable equilibrium.

---

## 3. The IPAT Relationship

A well-known conceptual relationship is the **IPAT equation**, used to express that environmental impact is driven by:

- Population
- Affluence (consumption per person)
- Technology (impact per unit of consumption)

This is commonly written as: $$ I = P \cdot A \cdot T $$

Important note: this should not necessarily be interpreted as “mathematically exact”, but as a conceptual model describing main drivers of total impact.

### 3.1 Implications of Trends

- **Population** has almost doubled over the last ~50 years, and is projected by the UN to keep increasing (with estimates reaching about $10.5$ billion by around $2075$). This implies $P$ increases.
- **Affluence** (economic growth) is widely treated as a central policy goal, and many projections expect significant growth across regions (including rapid growth in large emerging economies). This implies $A$ increases.

So the question becomes: how much must $T$ decrease to counterbalance increases in $P$ and $A$?

## 4. Planetary Boundaries and the Need to Reduce Impact

Planetary boundaries describe a “safe operating space” by identifying thresholds in key Earth-system processes. Key points:

- Earth-system conditions were relatively stable for about $10{,}000$ years (Holocene).
- Since the industrial revolution, human activity has become a major driver of environmental change (often framed as entering the “Anthropocene”).
- A set of **9** boundaries is typically discussed (e.g., climate change, ocean acidification, biogeochemical flows, etc.).
- **Six of the nine** boundaries have been transgressed to at least a zone of increased risk.

Overall implication:

- We need to reduce $I$ in the conceptual relationship $I = P \cdot A \cdot T$.

### 4.1 Technology Alone Is Not Enough

While technological improvements can reduce impact intensity, the text emphasizes:

- Needed efficiency improvements may be very large (discussed as factors roughly in the range of $4$ to $20$).
- **Rebound effects** occur: efficiency can make services cheaper, increasing consumption.
- Human demands can increase as affluence rises.

Conclusion: addressing $T$ alone is unlikely to be sufficient; consumption/demand also needs attention.

## 5. Why Life Cycle Thinking Is Necessary

A product’s **value chain** can include:

- Extraction of raw materials
- Manufacturing of components
- Assembly
- Transport
- Use phase
- End-of-life (reuse, recycling, disposal)

These activities are:

- Global (spread across countries and regions)
- Extended over time

Therefore, to assess environmental impacts, it is not enough to look only at the product “at rest” or only at one stage.

### 5.1 Example: Smartphone

A smartphone lying on a table has no immediate impact. Impacts arise through:

- Material extraction and processing
- Component production and assembly
- Energy production for manufacturing and use
- Transport
- End-of-life handling (reuse/recycling/disposal)

This full chain is what is meant by the **lifecycle of a product**.

---

## 6. LCA: Life Cycle Assessment

### 6.1 Technosphere vs. Ecosphere

- The lifecycle of the product unfolds in the **technosphere** (human-made systems of production, transport, use, waste).
- Environmental impacts occur in the **ecosphere** and are driven by:
  - emissions
  - resource extraction
  - other “elemental flows” induced by technosphere activities

LCA inventories inputs/outputs across the system and translates them into impact metrics through life cycle impact assessment.

### 6.2 LCA Is Not “Only for Circular Systems”

Although life cycles are often drawn as cycles, LCA is not dedicated to circular systems only. It can assess both linear and circular systems; it does not inherently distinguish them.

---

## 7. Standard Phases of an LCA

The LCA process is standardized and typically includes:

1. **Goal definition** “What is the question?”
2. **Scope / system boundary definition**

   The technosphere is huge, so boundaries are required:

   - what processes to include
   - what impact categories to include
   - which methods to apply

3. **Inventory (data collection)**

   Collect data on:

   - inputs (resources, energy, materials)
   - outputs (emissions, waste, products, co-products)

4. **Impact assessment (translation)**

   Translate inventory flows into environmental impacts.

5. **Interpretation**

  Interpret results to answer the original question.

## 8. Functional Unit: The Core of Comparative Assessment

A fundamental feature of LCA is that it evaluates the **service** provided to society. This is operationalized through a **functional unit**. A functional unit:

- defines *what function/service* is being assessed
- quantifies *how much service* is provided
- anchors comparisons between alternatives

### 8.1 Example: Milk Packaging

If comparing:

- a glass bottle (reusable)
- a carton/pack (single-use)

We do not compare “one bottle vs one pack”. We compare equivalent *service*. If the bottle is reused $30$ times, then the comparison might be framed as:

$$ 1 \text{ glass bottle used } 30 \text{ times} \quad \text{vs} \quad 30 \text{ packs} $$

But reuse requires additional washing and transport, which must be included in the system.

---

## 9. LCA Is a Relative Method

LCA is primarily for comparing alternatives, i.e., it makes **relative statements**. Example idea:

- “One person transported one kilometer” has different impacts depending on whether it is a big car or a smaller car.

However, LCA does not automatically answer:

> “Is this alternative sustainable in an absolute sense?”

It mainly supports *comparative* evaluation.

---

## 10. Holistic Perspective and Burden Shifting

LCA aims to cover the entire lifecycle and multiple impact categories, including:

- emissions and pollution impacts
- resource use (mineral, fossil, biomass)
- sometimes work environment (depending on scope)

A major strength is avoiding **problem shifting** between life cycle stages. Example concept:

- Replacing a plastic cup with a steel cup can shift impacts:
  - away from plastic disposal
  - toward steel raw material extraction and manufacturing

So the “better” option depends on the full life cycle.

---

## 11. Extending Beyond Environmental Impacts: Life Cycle Sustainability

So far, the focus is environmental, but sustainability has **three dimensions**:

- Environmental
- Economic
- Social

### 11.1 Economic Dimension

Life-cycle economic thinking includes:

- costs across the lifecycle
- examples of cost categories (purchase, operation, maintenance, etc.)

A note in the text emphasizes that external costs are not included in some contexts because they are already covered through environmental impacts in the LCA framing being used there.

### 11.2 Social Dimension

Social aspects include issues such as:

- poverty
- hunger
- gender equality
- broader welfare and equity concerns

The text highlights that progress is uneven and that social aspects need to be addressed in assessment.

---

## 12. Simplifying Sustainability Assessment: Prioritization and MECO

Because full Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is complex, a simplified approach is recommended:

- prioritize indicators based on:
  - the goal of the assessment
  - data availability
  - suggested initial priorities include:
    - contribution to climate change
    - production cost
    - fair wages (as an example of a social indicator)

MECO is presented as DTU’s simplified way to keep a life cycle perspective while focusing on key drivers and manageable data requirements.

---

## 13. Defining the Object of Assessment

Defining the object of assessment is critical for meaningful comparison. In LCA terms, this means defining the **functional unit** using:

### 13.1 Understanding the Product/System Context

Questions to answer:

- **What should the product be used for?** Describe the basic tasks and what the product does, including the technological principle and required features.
- **How long and how often?** Define time frames and use patterns.
- **Where in the world?** Specify the geographical context and likely end-of-life situation.

These answers help define the product’s value contribution to the user.

### 13.2 Identifying Central Properties

Two property types are emphasized:

- **Obligatory properties**

  Required for the product to fulfill its core function. Example: a window should allow daylight into a building while acting as a physical barrier.

- **Positioning properties**

  Qualitative aspects that influence consumer choice. Examples: color, noise insulation, etc.

These help shape a functional unit that reflects both quantitative service and key qualitative expectations.

---

## 14. Defining the Functional Unit

The functional unit should be:

- **quantitatively defined** (must be measurable)
- potentially include **qualitative requirements** relevant for fair comparison

Example idea given:

- when comparing food items, both should satisfy basic expectations (e.g., taste), while the provided service is quantified.

In general form:

$$ \text{Functional Unit} = \text{Quantified Service} + \text{Relevant Quality Constraints} $$

This completes the foundation needed before moving into specific assessment tools and indicators.
