# Chapter 9 – Social Sustainability and Health Assessment

## 1. Social Dimensions of Sustainability

Sustainability is not only concerned with environmental protection and economic performance, but also with **social well-being**. The social dimension of sustainability focuses on:

- human welfare,  
- equity,  
- health,  
- employment,  
- working conditions,  
- and social justice.

A central objective is ensuring that the transition toward a more sustainable society does **not leave anyone behind**.

---

## 2. The Role of Companies in Social Sustainability

Companies play a key role in shaping social outcomes through:

- employment practices,  
- supply chains,  
- product design,  
- and investment decisions.

Social sustainability therefore extends beyond national policy and must be integrated into corporate decision-making.

---

## 3. Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA)

### 3.1 Concept of S-LCA

Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) is a methodology developed to evaluate the **social and socio-economic impacts** of products and services across their entire life cycle. S-LCA complements:

- Environmental LCA,  
- Life Cycle Costing (LCC).

---

### 3.2 Scope of S-LCA

S-LCA assesses:

- employment,  
- workplace health and safety,  
- equity,  
- broader social impacts along value chains.

It is increasingly established as a tool for social sustainability assessment. Guidance is provided by:

- UNEP/SETAC,  
- UNDP (Social Life Cycle Assessment, 2020).

---

## 4. Social Impact Assessment Within S-LCA

### 4.1 Purpose

The social impact assessment phase aims to:

- calculate,  
- understand,  
- and evaluate the **magnitude and significance** of social impacts associated with a product or service throughout its life cycle.

---

### 4.2 Two Approaches to Social Impact Assessment

#### 4.2.1 Reference Scale Approach

- Measures social performance or social risk.  
- Uses reference data to compare products or services.  
- Focuses on relative performance.

---

#### 4.2.2 Impact Pathway Approach

- Evaluates **consequential social impacts**.  
- Traces cause–effect relationships.  
- Examines how a product or service indirectly affects society.

This approach asks:

> If a product is purchased or used, how does this affect society through different mechanisms?

---

## 5. S-LCA Methodological Steps

S-LCA generally follows four main steps:

1. **Objective and Scope Definition**  
   Define the product or service and the purpose of the assessment.  
2. **Stakeholder Identification and Inventory Indicators**  
   Identify all stakeholders affected across the life cycle.  
3. **Social Impact Assessment**  
4. **Interpretation**

---

### 5.1 Stakeholders in S-LCA

Stakeholders may include:

- workers,  
- consumers,  
- local communities,  
- society at large,  
- value chain actors.

Indirect impacts may also be considered.

---

### 5.2 Important Clarification

S-LCA:

- does **not** aim to decide whether a product should exist,  
- but rather evaluates its social impacts.

---

## 6. Data and Databases for S-LCA

Two main databases are commonly used:

- **Social Hotspots Database (SHDB)**  
- **Product Social Impact Life Cycle Assessment (PSILCA)**

These databases:

- provide country- and sector-specific data,  
- assume social impact pathways exist along value chains,  
- support generic social impact modeling.

---

## 7. Impact Pathway-Based Social Life Cycle Impact Assessment (IP S-LCIA)

### 7.1 Concept

Impact pathway-based S-LCIA aims to:

- model relationships between social stressors (causes),  
- and social outcomes (effects).

This involves tracing inventory data through social and socio-economic mechanisms.

---

### 7.2 Qualitative and Quantitative Pathways

Impact pathways can be:

- qualitative,  
- quantitative,  
- or a combination of both.

Increasingly, focus is placed on **human health impacts**.

---

## 8. Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)

### 8.1 Definition

DALYs measure the **burden of disease** by capturing:

- premature mortality,  
- and years lived with disability.

DALYs represent **years of healthy life lost**.

Formally:

$$ \text{DALY} = \text{Years of Life Lost (YLL)} + \text{Years Lived with Disability (YLD)} $$

---

### 8.2 Interpretation

DALYs measure the gap between:

- current health status,  
- and an ideal scenario where people live long, healthy lives.

---

## 9. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD)

### 9.1 Purpose of GBD

The Global Burden of Disease project provides:

- worldwide comparison of health status,  
- causes of death,  
- and risk factors.

It covers approximately $153$ countries.

---

### 9.2 Risk Factors vs. Causes

- **Causes**: Diseases or injuries to which DALYs are attributed.  
- **Risk factors**: Modifiable drivers that increase disease or injury risk.

---

## 10. DALYs vs. Death Counts

DALYs differ from simple death counts by accounting for:

- age at death,  
- duration of disability.

Example insight:

- Malnutrition ranks lower in deaths but higher in DALYs, because it primarily affects children, resulting in many years of life lost.

---

## 11. Example of DALY Calculation

Consider a person who:

- develops cancer at age $72$,  
- dies at age $75$,  
- has a life expectancy of $90.3$ years.

Years of life lost:

$$ \text{YLL} = 90.3 - 75 = 15.3 $$

Years lived with disability (example weight):

$$ \text{YLD} = 0.3 \times 3 = 0.9 $$

Total:

$$ \text{DALY} = 15.3 + 0.9 = 16.2 $$

---

## 12. Health Risk Factors Identified by GBD

GBD identifies major global risk factors, including:

- dietary risks,  
- air pollution,  
- malnutrition,  
- physical inactivity.

Dietary risks alone account for approximately $11$ million deaths per year globally.

---

## 13. Measuring Health Impacts of Products and Lifestyles

### 13.1 From DALYs to Micro-DALYs

Individual products often cause **very small health impacts**. To improve interpretability, impacts can be expressed as:

- **micro-DALYs**,  
- or minutes of life lost or gained per day.

Example:

- A year contains approximately $0.5$ million minutes.  
- Small daily effects accumulate meaningfully over time.

---

## 14. Health Impact Pathways from Consumption

Products and activities affect health through multiple pathways:

- Climate change  
- Fine particulate matter (PM)  
- Nutrition  
- Physical activity  
- Chemicals in products

Individuals are exposed to a **mixture** of these impacts.

---

## 15. Examples of Health Impacts

### 15.1 Air Pollution

Estimated life expectancy losses:

- New York City: up to $12$ minutes/day  
- Beijing: up to $25$ minutes/day  
- New Delhi: up to $35$ minutes/day  
- Indoor wood stove use: up to $45$ minutes/day

---

### 15.2 Lifestyle Activities

- Burning incense at high levels: approximately $20$ minutes of life lost per day.

---

### 15.3 Nutrition and Physical Activity

- Certain nutrients increase life expectancy.  
- Others reduce it.  
- Physical activity benefits are quantified using **METs**.

---

## 16. Climate Change and Health

Climate change affects health through:

- heat stress,  
- cold exposure,  
- extreme events.

These impacts are unevenly distributed globally, raising issues of environmental justice.

---

## 17. Global Inequity in Health Impacts

On average:

- global lifestyles generate approximately $200$ minutes of healthy life lost per day per capita.

However:

- impacts are uneven,  
- those contributing least often suffer most.

---

## 18. Vision for Integrated Health Assessment

The long-term vision is to:

- combine data on where people live and work,  
- account for lifestyle and consumption,  
- and estimate impacts on life expectancy.

This approach complements genetic information by focusing on modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors.

---

## 19. Key Takeaways

- Social sustainability is central to sustainability transitions.  
- S-LCA evaluates social impacts across life cycles.  
- Impact pathways link products to social outcomes.  
- DALYs provide a comprehensive health metric.  
- GBD enables global comparison of health risks.

- DALYs capture both mortality and morbidity.  
- Products and lifestyles affect health through multiple pathways.  
- Quantitative health metrics support more informed decisions.  
- Equity and justice are fundamental to sustainable development.
