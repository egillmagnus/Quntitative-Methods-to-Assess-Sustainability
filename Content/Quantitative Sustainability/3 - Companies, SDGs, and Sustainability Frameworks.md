# Chapter 3 – Companies, Sustainable Development Goals, and Corporate Sustainability

## 1. The Role of Companies in Sustainability

Companies play a central role in the transition toward more sustainable economic systems. Their decisions influence:

- resource use,  
- emissions,  
- employment,  
- innovation,  
- and social well-being.

Sustainability is therefore not only a governmental or societal issue, but also a corporate one.

---

## 2. Sustainable Development Goals: Focus and Scope

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cover a wide range of themes. Broadly, SDGs can be grouped into:

- **Socio-economic goals**  
- **Environmental goals**  
- **Technology-driven goals**

A large number of SDGs are explicitly or implicitly technology-driven, meaning that technological development and innovation can significantly accelerate progress toward these goals. This raises an important question:

> How do SDGs, which are designed at a national level, translate to company-level action?

---

## 3. The Challenge of Applying SDGs to Companies

SDGs were developed primarily for **nation-states**, not for individual firms. This creates several challenges for companies:

- SDGs are broad and high-level.  
- Companies operate at smaller, more specific scales.  
- Firms must determine which goals are most relevant to their activities.  
- Companies need ways to set priorities, define targets, and measure impact.

To address these challenges, dedicated frameworks were developed.

---

## 4. The SDG Compass

### 4.1 Purpose of the SDG Compass

The **SDG Compass** was created to help companies operationalize the SDGs. It supports companies in:

- understanding the SDGs,  
- identifying relevant goals,  
- defining priorities,  
- setting measurable targets,  
- integrating sustainability into strategy,  
- tracking and reporting progress.

Conceptually, corporate engagement can be summarized as:

$$ \text{SDG Engagement} = \text{Understand} + \text{Prioritize} + \text{Integrate} + \text{Measure} + \text{Report} $$

---

## 5. Corporate Engagement with the SDGs

### 5.1 Key Steps for Companies

Companies engaging with SDGs typically follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the SDGs**  
   Become familiar with goals, targets, and indicators.

2. **Prioritization**  
   Identify SDGs where the company has:  
   - the greatest positive impact, or  
   - the greatest negative impact that needs mitigation.

3. **Goal and Target Setting**  
   Translate SDGs into SMART objectives aligned with business operations.

4. **Integration**  
   Embed sustainability into:  
   - corporate strategy,  
   - operations,  
   - investment decisions,  
   - innovation processes.

5. **Reporting and Communication**  
   Measure, track, and disclose progress transparently.

---

## 6. Benefits of Corporate Sustainability Engagement

Engaging with sustainability and SDGs can generate tangible benefits for companies.

### 6.1 Operational and Economic Benefits

- Cost savings (e.g., energy efficiency, waste reduction)  
- Improved operational efficiency  
- Risk management and regulatory preparedness

### 6.2 Strategic and Social Benefits

- Enhanced corporate reputation  
- Increased employee satisfaction and retention  
- Improved stakeholder trust  
- Innovation and competitive advantage

Empirical studies show a **positive relationship between sustainability performance and firm value**, including market and stock valuation.

---

## 7. Sustainability Performance and Firm Value

Academic analyses of large companies (e.g., N100 and G250 firms) reveal:

- A rapid increase in sustainability reporting since around $2017$.  
- Growing integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations.  
- Evidence that strong sustainability performance correlates with:  
  - higher firm value,  
  - improved market perception,  
  - long-term competitiveness.

This suggests sustainability is not only a moral or ethical concern, but also an economic one.

---

## 8. Corporate Sustainability Initiatives and Frameworks

Companies engage in sustainability through a range of initiatives:

- **UN Global Compact**  
  Companies commit to sustainability principles and reporting.
  SDG Compass & Science based targets

- **Science-Based Targets**  
  Firms commit to greenhouse gas reduction pathways aligned with climate science.

- **Sector-Specific Certification Schemes**  
  Example: DGNB in the building sector.

- **Increased Transparency**  
  Companies increasingly report both positive and negative impacts.

These initiatives help standardize sustainability practices and signal commitment.

---

## 9. Sustainability Reporting Trends

Analyses of corporate sustainability reports show:

- Strong growth in reporting among large companies.  
- Increasing use of SDGs as a reporting framework.  
- Identification of both positive and negative impacts across SDGs.

The most frequently prioritized SDGs by companies include:

- Decent work and economic growth  
- Climate action  
- Responsible consumption and production  
- Affordable and clean energy  
- Industry, innovation, and infrastructure

Some companies report comprehensively, while others still report selectively or not at all.

---

## 10. Guidelines and Regulation for Sustainability Reporting

Sustainability reporting is increasingly shaped by formal guidelines and regulation. Examples include:

- **NASDAQ ESG Reporting Guide**  
- Emerging **EU sustainability reporting requirements**

These frameworks aim to:

- improve consistency,  
- enhance transparency,  
- reduce greenwashing,  
- increase comparability across companies.

---

## 11. European Taxonomy for Sustainable Investment

The **European taxonomy for sustainable investment** provides a classification system to determine whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable. It is used to:

- rank investment opportunities,  
- guide capital allocation,  
- support sustainable finance decisions.

This represents a shift from voluntary reporting toward more regulated sustainability disclosure.

---

## 12. Key Takeaways

- Companies are central actors in sustainability transitions.  
- SDGs must be translated from national goals to company-level action.  
- The SDG Compass provides structured guidance for this translation.  
- Sustainability engagement can create economic, strategic, and social value.  
- Reporting and transparency are rapidly increasing.  
- Regulation is playing a growing role in shaping corporate sustainability behavior.

---

## 13. Conclusion

Corporate sustainability is no longer optional. Companies are increasingly expected to:

- measure their impacts,  
- align with global sustainability goals,  
- report transparently,  
- and integrate sustainability into core strategy.

The challenge ahead is ensuring that corporate sustainability efforts are:

- credible,  
- measurable,  
- and meaningfully aligned with global sustainability objectives.

## 14. Stepwise Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) – Tier Framework

### 14.1 What the Figure Represents (Big Picture)

The Stepwise LCSA framework illustrates a **stepwise approach to Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA)**. Instead of treating sustainability assessment as “all-or-nothing,” it recognizes **three tiers** with increasing depth, data intensity, and analytical ambition.

Core idea:

- Start simple (**Tier 1**) to get broad, robust signals.
- Refine and deepen (**Tier 2**) when decisions justify it.
- Expand to full sustainability coverage (**Tier 3**) when stakes, data, and resources allow.

This avoids two common problems:

- **Over-engineering** early studies with unrealistic data demands.
- **Under-informing** high-impact decisions with overly simple metrics.

---

### 14.2 Tier 1 – Sustainability Footprint (Screening)

Tier 1 focuses on a **limited set of globally relevant, well-established indicators** that are:

- easy to calculate,
- widely accepted,
- comparable across studies and regions.

You are essentially asking:

> “Is this option broadly better or worse from a sustainability perspective?”

Typical characteristics:

- few indicators (often mostly environmental),
- generic datasets (e.g., database averages),
- limited system boundaries,
- high robustness, low specificity.

Examples of Tier 1 indicators:

- **Carbon footprint (kg CO₂-eq)**
  - global relevance, mature methods, data widely available.
- **Energy use / cumulative energy demand (MJ)**
  - straightforward, often correlates with multiple impacts.
- **Water use (m³)**
  - useful first-order screening, but does **not** capture local scarcity.

What Tier 1 is not:

- does not capture local impacts well,
- does not reflect full social/economic complexity,
- does not capture supply-chain feedback effects.

Tier 1 answers:

> “Is this direction sensible at all?”

---

### 14.3 Tier 2 – Best Practice LCSA (Decision Support)

Tier 2 represents **current best practice** life-cycle assessment for decision support. It aims to be **decision-relevant**, not just indicative.

You are now asking:

> “Which option is better, and why, considering the full supply chain?”

Typical characteristics:

- broader set of indicators,
- environmental + economic + selected social indicators,
- improved spatial, technological, and temporal resolution,
- full cradle-to-grave (or cradle-to-cradle) scope.

Examples of Tier 2 analyses:

- **Multiple environmental indicators** (e.g., climate change + toxicity + ecosystem impacts)
  - reveals trade-offs across impact categories.
- **Water scarcity–weighted water use**
  - accounts for *where* water is used (regionalized factors).
- **Life-cycle cost (LCC)**
  - includes cost time profiles and discounting; goes beyond CAPEX-only comparisons.
- **Social indicators with proxies**
  - uses hotspot/risk databases (e.g., child labor risk, accident rates), often based on sector averages.

What Tier 2 enables:

- identification of trade-offs,
- better investment and policy decisions,
- more credible stakeholder communication.

Tier 2 answers:

> “What is the best option, given what we realistically know today?”

---

### 14.4 Tier 3 – Comprehensive Assessment (Policy & System Insight)

Tier 3 aims for a **fully integrated sustainability assessment**, including:

- environmental,
- economic,
- social,
- system-level and economy-wide effects.

This is often research-level or high-stakes policy-level analysis.

You are now asking:

> “How does this intervention reshape sustainability across society and the economy?”

Examples of Tier 3 analyses:

- **Economy-wide employment effects** (IO or CGE-type modelling)
  - includes indirect/induced effects and supply-chain restructuring.
- **Distributional and equity impacts**
  - who benefits vs who bears costs (group/region-specific impacts).
- **Long-term system transformation effects**
  - rebound effects, learning curves, behavioral change, lock-in.
- **Full LCSA with integrated weighting/normalization**
  - requires explicit value judgments tailored to decision context.

What Tier 3 is not:

- not always necessary,
- not always more “correct,”
- not always feasible for industry practice.

Tier 3 answers:

> “What does this mean for sustainability at the societal level?”

---

### 14.5 Why the Stepwise Structure Matters

Tier summary:

- **Tier 1 (screening):** “Is this broadly better or worse?”
- **Tier 2 (decision support):** “Which option should we choose?”
- **Tier 3 (policy/system insight):** “How does this reshape society and sustainability?”

Key insight:

- Move up tiers **only when the decision context justifies the added complexity**.

One-sentence takeaway:

> Sustainability assessment should scale with decision importance: start with robust, simple indicators and progress toward comprehensive system-level analysis only when necessary.

---

### 14.6 Examples of Indicators by Tier (Exam-Friendly)

**Tier 1 – Sustainability Footprint (low-entry, screening level)**

These indicators are globally relevant, relatively easy to quantify, and commonly used for first-order comparisons:

- **Climate change**
  - Tier 1 because greenhouse gas emissions are well defined, widely measured, and supported by mature methods (e.g. GWP).
- **Land use**
  - Tier 1 when treated in an aggregated way (e.g. land occupation / land transformation) without detailed biodiversity or ecosystem modelling.
- **Eutrophication**
  - Tier 1 when expressed as a generic nutrient load (e.g. kg PO₄³⁻-eq) for broad environmental screening.

**Tier 2 – Best Practice LCSA (decision-oriented, supply-chain aware)**

These indicators require more detailed modelling, better data, or context-specific assumptions, but are still common in applied LCA/LCSA:

- **Ecotoxicity**
  - Tier 2 because it relies on complex fate, exposure, and effect modelling and typically has higher uncertainty.
- **Human health**
  - Tier 2 when assessed via midpoint/endpoint pathways (e.g. DALYs from air pollution or toxicity).
- **Production costs**
  - Tier 2 as part of LCC (costs across the life cycle, not only upfront).
- **Consumer costs**
  - Tier 2 because they require assumptions about use patterns, prices, discount rates, and lifetime.

**Tier 3 – Comprehensive Assessment (system-level, societal scope)**

These indicators are harder to quantify, context-dependent, and often require qualitative judgment or broader socio-economic modelling:

- **Working conditions** (job quality, safety, labour standards)
- **Fair wages** (depends on living-wage benchmarks, norms, and distribution)
- **Human rights** (often assessed via risk indicators and governance context)

One-line summary (exam-friendly):

- Tier 1: simple, global, robust environmental indicators
- Tier 2: detailed environmental and economic indicators suitable for concrete decisions
- Tier 3: social, ethical, and system-level impacts requiring broader societal analysis
