# Chapter 5 – Carbon Footprint and Environmental Indicators

## 1. Quantifying Sustainability Through Indicators

To quantify sustainability, we rely on **indicators**. Indicators exist at different levels and correspond to different stages in the cause–effect chain linking human activity to environmental and social impacts. A key challenge is ensuring that sustainability indicators are:

- consistent,  
- comparable,  
- meaningful across contexts.

## 2. Global Warming as a Central Sustainability Challenge

### 2.1 Observed Climate Change

Global average temperatures have increased rapidly in recent decades. This increase is largely attributed to **human activities**. If warming were driven primarily by:

- solar variability, or  
- volcanic activity,  

temperature changes would be more stable over time.

Observed consequences of rising temperatures include:

- melting ice sheets and glaciers,  
- rising sea levels (potentially between $1$ m and $7$ m),  
- increased frequency and severity of extreme events.

Under a “business-as-usual” scenario, temperature increases could reach approximately $8.5^\circ\text{C}$, which would lead to severe and potentially irreversible impacts.

## 3. Unequal Contribution and Unequal Impact

An important sustainability insight is the **disconnect between responsibility and impact**.

- Regions such as **North America and Europe** contribute disproportionately to greenhouse gas emissions.  
- Regions such as **Africa and South Asia** experience a larger share of human health damages.

This highlights climate change as both:

- an environmental problem, and  
- a global justice issue.

## 4. From Human Activity to Impact: The DPSIR Framework

Environmental indicators can be positioned along the **DPSIR framework**:

- **Drivers**: Human activities (e.g., kilometers driven by cars)  
- **Pressures**: Emissions and resource use (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions)  
- **State**: Changes in environmental conditions (e.g., increased radiative forcing)  
- **Impact**: Effects on ecosystems, human health, and well-being (e.g., temperature rise)  
- **Response**: Societal actions to mitigate or adapt (e.g., policy, technology, behavior change)

This framework helps clarify *where* in the causal chain a given indicator operates.

---

## 5. Carbon Footprint as an Indicator

The **carbon footprint** is designed to compare different greenhouse gas emissions by translating them into a common unit.

### 5.1 Greenhouse Gases and Comparability

Different greenhouse gases differ in:

- atmospheric lifetime,  
- radiative forcing strength.

To compare them, the concept of **Global Warming Potential (GWP)** is used.

---

## 6. Global Warming Potential (GWP)

### 6.1 Definition

Global Warming Potential measures the warming effect of a greenhouse gas relative to carbon dioxide over a defined time horizon (commonly $100$ years). Formally:

$$ \text{GWP}_{100}(g) = \frac{\text{Integrated radiative forcing of gas } g}{\text{Integrated radiative forcing of } CO_2} $$

This allows emissions of different gases to be expressed in **CO₂-equivalents**.

---

## 7. Calculating Carbon Footprint

To calculate a carbon footprint:

1. Identify emissions of different greenhouse gases.  
2. Multiply each emission by its respective GWP factor.  
3. Sum the results to obtain total emissions in CO₂-equivalents.

Formally:

$$ \text{Carbon Footprint} = \sum_i E_i \cdot \text{GWP}_i $$

where:

- $E_i$ is the emission of gas $i$.

---

## 8. Example: Carbon Footprint per Capita

For example, when calculating the average carbon footprint per capita (e.g., in Denmark):

- emissions of CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, etc. are identified,  
- each is multiplied by its GWP,  
- results are summed to obtain a total GWP score.

Once emissions are expressed in the same unit, they can be directly compared and aggregated.

---

## 9. Carbon Footprint Across Scales

Carbon footprints can be calculated for:

- individuals,  
- products,  
- services,  
- organizations,  
- countries.

A critical question is:

> At which level of the cause–effect chain is the carbon footprint measured?

Carbon footprints typically sit between:

- **pressures** (emissions) and  
- **impacts** (temperature change).

---

## 10. Carbon Footprint Is Only One Impact Category

Carbon footprint captures **climate change impact only**. However, sustainability assessment requires considering multiple environmental impact categories, such as:

- acidification,  
- eutrophication,  
- toxicity,  
- resource depletion,  
- land use.

Thus, carbon footprint is necessary but not sufficient.

---

## 11. Why Multiple Environmental Indicators Are Needed

Different indicators characterize different drivers and impacts. Using only one indicator risks:

- overlooking important trade-offs,  
- shifting problems rather than solving them.

Environmental indicators should therefore be selected to:

- capture key drivers,  
- reflect relevant impacts,  
- support informed decision-making.

---

## 12. Indicators Along the Cause–Effect Chain

Indicators can be placed at different stages:

- **Activity-based indicators** (e.g., kilometers driven)  
- **Emission-based indicators** (e.g., CO₂ emissions)  
- **Impact-based indicators** (e.g., temperature change, DALYs in later chapters)

Each type answers different questions and serves different decision contexts.

---

## 13. Interpretation and Use of Carbon Footprints

Carbon footprints are useful for:

- comparing alternatives,  
- identifying hotspots,  
- informing mitigation strategies.

However, they must be interpreted carefully:

- they do not capture all environmental impacts,  
- they do not directly measure human well-being,  
- they are sensitive to system boundaries and assumptions.

## 14. Summary and Key Takeaways

- Climate change is a central sustainability challenge driven by human activity.  
- Contributions and impacts are unevenly distributed globally.  
- Indicators help translate complex systems into measurable quantities.  
- The DPSIR framework clarifies causal relationships.  
- Carbon footprint uses GWP to aggregate greenhouse gas emissions.  
- Carbon footprint is a pressure–impact indicator, not a full sustainability measure.  
- Multiple indicators are required for comprehensive sustainability assessment.

This chapter establishes carbon footprinting as a foundational but incomplete tool within the broader sustainability assessment framework.
