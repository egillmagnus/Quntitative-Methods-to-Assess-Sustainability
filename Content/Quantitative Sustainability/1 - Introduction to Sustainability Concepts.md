# Chapter 1 – Introduction to Sustainability Concepts

## 1. What Is Sustainability?

Sustainability is a concept that touches on a fundamental aspect of human experience. It forces us to reflect on what it means to live as individuals, to live with others, and to interact both **in nature** and **with nature**. These reflections are shaped by individual experiences. Since people belong to different communities and cultures, they develop different interactions with people and nature, which in turn shape their worldviews. A worldview influences how new experiences are interpreted and how they are placed into the “ledger” of one’s life. As a result, the value people ascribe to interactions with nature and with others differs depending on their worldview. For example, what one person sees as a parrot may be seen by someone else simply as food. This illustrates that value is not inherent, but contextual.

## 2. The Core Problem of Sustainability

A fundamental problem emerges from these differing value systems:

> If individuals and societies ascribe different values to experiences and to nature,  
> does this mean we all hold fundamentally different views about the relationship  
> between humans and nature?

The answer is **yes**. This diversity of values lies at the heart of sustainability challenges, particularly because sustainability issues are often global in nature and require collective action.

## 3. Perceptions of the World and Human–Nature Relationships

Human perceptions of the world can be grouped into three broad categories.

### 3.1 Humans Have a Special Place in Nature

- Humans are seen as dominant over nature.  
- Nature is viewed as something over which humans have dominion.  
- Humans are free to use nature as they choose, within socially accepted boundaries.

### 3.2 Nature Needs Protection

- Humans are viewed as stewards of nature.  
- Nature is fragile and requires human protection.  
- Humans have a special responsibility to manage and safeguard natural systems.

### 3.3 Humans Are Not Special

- Humans are simply one species among many.  
- There is no special human role in nature.  
- Humans should minimize their footprint and avoid limiting opportunities for others.

These perspectives influence how people value nature and how they value other people. They also shape ethical judgments, policy preferences, and economic decisions.

## 4. Worldviews and Value Hierarchies

People assign different specific values to nature’s contributions depending on their worldviews. This leads to **hierarchies of value formation**. Within this framework, four dominant worldviews are identified:

- **Living from nature**: Nature is primarily a resource to be used for human benefit.  
- **Living with nature**: Humans coexist with nature and must respect ecological limits.  
- **Living as nature**: Humans are an inseparable part of nature.  
- **Living in nature**: Humans exist within natural systems but maintain some separation.

Understanding these worldviews is essential because sustainability challenges require cooperation across societies that do not share the same values.

## 5. Sustainability as a Global Challenge

Many sustainability challenges are global in nature, even when they appear local. Because people and societies hold diverse worldviews, agreeing on what is valuable becomes difficult. This raises a key question:

> How can a common vision of sustainability be constructed when there is no  
> agreement on what is valuable?

---

## 6. A Global Definition of Sustainability (Rio 1992)

In 1992, at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, a common definition of sustainability was articulated:

> Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development.  
> They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature.  
>  
> The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet the  
> developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations.  
>  
> Environmental protection shall constitute an integral part of the development  
> process and cannot be considered in isolation from it.

This definition attempts to bridge differing worldviews by placing humans at the center while explicitly acknowledging environmental limits and intergenerational equity.

## 7. Key Takeaways on Sustainability

- Sustainability is a **diverse and value-dependent concept**.  
- Individuals and societies hold intrinsic views of sustainability that may diverge.  
- Sustainability depends on worldviews about the relationship between people and nature.  
- There is **no single optimal definition** of sustainability.

This leads to a major challenge:

> How do we move forward if sustainability is so difficult to define?  
> How can we measure sustainability if we cannot fully agree on its meaning?

---

## 8. Historical Context of Sustainability

### 8.1 Early Global Recognition

- **1948 – Universal Declaration of Human Rights**: Established equal rights to opportunities, creating a need to reconcile development with environmental and social goals.  
- **1972 – Stockholm Declaration**: Recognized that human activities can have global environmental impacts, not just local ones. Highlighted that there are limits to human activity and raised questions about equity among nations.

These developments marked a shift from purely local environmental concerns to global sustainability thinking.

---

## 9. The Road to Rio 1992

The international sustainability discourse emerged from the interaction between:

- Economic development thinking  
- Environmentalism

The Rio process aimed to reconcile:

- Development needs (particularly in low- and middle-income countries)  
- Environmental protection  
- Equity between nations and generations

This framing remains central to sustainability today.

---

## 10. Framing Sustainability

Sustainability is fundamentally about balancing:

- Equitable economic development  
- Environmental preservation  
- Human well-being

This balance must be achieved both within and across generations.

---

## 11. The Three Capitals Framework

Sustainability is often conceptualized through three interconnected forms of capital.

### 11.1 Social Capital

- People  
- Communities  
- Social institutions

### 11.2 Economic Capital

- Infrastructure  
- Economies  
- Financial systems

### 11.3 Environmental Capital

- Ecosystems  
- Biodiversity  
- Natural resources

The objective is to derive **income (benefits)** from these capitals while maintaining their stocks for future generations. Conceptually, sustainability can be expressed as:

$$ \text{Sustainability} = \text{Use of capital without capital depletion} $$

---

## 12. Agents and Linkages Within the Capitals

The three capitals are composed of agents and linkages:

- Infrastructure, people, and species  
- Economies, communities, and ecosystems

Income is generated through interactions among these agents. Sustainability requires that these interactions do not erode the underlying capital.

## 13. Alternative Frameworks

### 13.1 Bearable, Equitable, and Viable Outcomes

Some frameworks emphasize intersections between:

- Social and environmental systems (bearable)  
- Social and economic systems (equitable)  
- Economic and environmental systems (viable)

### 13.2 Embedded Pillars Perspective

Another perspective views:

- Economies embedded within societies  
- Societies embedded within planetary systems

Key implications:

- Societies cannot exceed planetary capacity.  
- Economies cannot grow beyond social and environmental means.

---

## 14. Conclusion

There is now a global consensus on a general definition and framing of sustainability, despite differing worldviews.

### Core Conclusions

- Sustainability is fundamentally about people.  
- It requires balancing social, economic, and environmental needs.  
- Consensus-building is a long-term process (from 1972 to 1992, and still ongoing).

### Final Reflection

> Will we have enough time to achieve the ambitions set for sustainability?  

This question remains open and central as sustainability efforts continue.
