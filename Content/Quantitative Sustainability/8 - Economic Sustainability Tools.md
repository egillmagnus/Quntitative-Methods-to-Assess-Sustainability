# Chapter 8 – Economic Sustainability Tools for Society

## 1. Economic Dimensions of Sustainability

Sustainability is not only about minimizing environmental impacts. It is also about enhancing **economic and social well-being** for society. To support sustainable decision-making, a range of **quantitative tools** has been developed. These tools help companies, institutions, and policymakers evaluate trade-offs between costs, benefits, and impacts.

A core motivation is summarized by the principle:

> If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it.

---

## 2. Why Use Sustainability Tools?

Companies and institutions play a central role in transitioning toward more sustainable economic systems. Despite the availability of many tools:

- they are often underused,  
- decisions are frequently made without systematic assessment.

Sustainability tools help:

- structure decision-making,  
- quantify impacts and costs,  
- support more informed choices.

---

## 3. Overview of Key Economic Sustainability Tools

The main tools discussed include:

- Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)  
- Material Flow Analysis (MFA)  
- Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)  
- Input–Output (IO) Models  
- Environmentally Extended Input–Output (EEIO) Models  
- Sustainability Indicators and Indices  
- Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA)  
- Life Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA)  
- Optimisation Methods

Each tool addresses different questions and operates at different system levels.

---

## 4. Material Flow Analysis (MFA)

### 4.1 Definition

Material Flow Analysis quantifies:

- inputs,  
- outputs,  
- and stocks of materials or substances within a defined system.

It provides a simplified model of the interaction between the economy and the environment.

---

### 4.2 Key Characteristics of MFA

- Focuses on physical flows (mass-based).  
- Often applied at a **single point in time**.  
- Can be applied to:  
  - products,  
  - processes,  
  - sectors,  
  - or entire economies.

MFA highlights that the economy is an **embedded subsystem of the environment** and depends on a continuous throughput of materials and energy.

---

### 4.3 Example Application

For example, when analyzing an electric vehicle:

- MFA can quantify materials used in each component,  
- assess environmental and cost implications of production.

However, MFA alone does not capture:

- use-phase impacts,  
- end-of-life impacts,  
- or long-term dynamics.

Thus, MFA is often seen as a **precursor** to Life Cycle Assessment.

---

## 5. Input–Output (IO) Models

### 5.1 Purpose of IO Models

Input–Output models describe the **interdependencies** between different branches of the economy. They capture both:

- direct effects,  
- indirect effects of production and consumption.

---

### 5.2 Economic Insights from IO Models

IO models are used to assess impacts on:

- employment,  
- gross value added (GVA),  
- profits,  
- sectoral output.

They are widely used in economic analysis and policymaking.

---

### 5.3 Direct and Indirect Effects

For a given sector $X$:

- **Direct effect**: Impact of expenditures within sector $X$.  
- **Indirect effect**: Impact on other sectors supplying inputs to sector $X$.

IO models systematically quantify these effects.

---

### 5.4 Multipliers

IO models can calculate **multipliers**, such as:

- employment multipliers,  
- value-added multipliers.

Example interpretation:

- A $1$ currency unit increase in demand in agriculture may generate more than $1$ unit of total economic activity when indirect effects are included.

---

## 6. Environmentally Extended Input–Output Models (EEIO)

EEIO models combine:

- monetary IO data,  
- environmental extensions (e.g., emissions).

They allow analysis of:

- how economic consumption drives environmental impacts,  
- both directly and indirectly across supply chains.

Often, positive economic impacts appear to outweigh negative ones in purely monetary terms — highlighting the need for environmental integration.

---

## 7. Policy Relevance of IO Models

IO and EEIO models provide information critical to policymakers:

- which sectors generate the most employment,  
- which sectors produce the most economic value,  
- where investments may yield the highest returns.

However:

- IO models are primarily monetary,  
- they do not inherently capture environmental or social sustainability.

---

## 8. Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA)

### 8.1 Definition

Cost–Benefit Analysis estimates:

- costs,  
- benefits of a project by expressing them in **monetary terms**.

---

### 8.2 Role in Sustainability Analysis

CBA often uses outputs from:

- LCA,  
- IO models to monetize environmental and social impacts.

This allows comparison between alternatives based on net benefits.

However:

- monetizing environmental and social impacts is complex,  
- results depend heavily on assumptions and valuation methods.

---

## 9. Life Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA)

### 9.1 Definition

Life Cycle Costing assesses the **total cost** of an asset over its entire life cycle. This includes:

- initial capital costs,  
- operating costs,  
- maintenance costs,  
- end-of-life costs,  
- residual value.

---

### 9.2 Role in Sustainability

LCCA supports:

- producer decision-making,  
- consumer decision-making.

It shifts focus from upfront costs to **long-term economic performance**. LCCA is often combined with environmental assessment to evaluate sustainability more holistically.

---

## 10. Example: Gasoline Vehicles vs. Electric Vehicles

A deep-dive example examines:

- gasoline cars vs. electric vehicles (EVs),  
- costs across their life course,  
- different electricity generation mixes,  
- different ownership models.

Key insight:

- EVs are often cheaper over their life cycle, but upfront costs remain a barrier.

---

## 11. Social and Environmental Justice Considerations

### 11.1 Accessibility and Equity

Although EVs may be cheaper in the long term:

- high upfront costs limit access for low-income households.

This challenges the assumption that long-term savings imply accessibility.

---

### 11.2 Leasing as an Alternative

Leasing models can:

- reduce upfront cost barriers,  
- improve access to EVs.

Life cycle economic analysis can be applied to leasing to evaluate true costs over time.

---

## 12. Socioeconomic Inequality: Sam Vimes “Boots” Theory

The analysis connects to the **Sam Vimes “Boots” theory of socioeconomic unfairness**:

- People in poverty buy cheaper, lower-quality products.  
- These products require frequent replacement.  
- Over time, this becomes more expensive than higher-quality alternatives.

This illustrates how economic constraints can reinforce inequality, even when sustainable options are cheaper in the long run.

---

## 13. Key Takeaways

- Sustainability tools support informed economic decision-making.  
- MFA provides a material-based snapshot of systems.  
- IO models capture economy-wide interdependencies.  
- EEIO links economic activity to environmental impact.  
- CBA monetizes costs and benefits but depends on assumptions.  
- LCCA evaluates total life-cycle costs.  
- Distributional and equity issues are central to sustainability.

---

## 14. Summary

- Economic sustainability requires quantitative tools.  
- Different tools answer different questions.  
- No single tool is sufficient.  
- Combining tools provides a more complete sustainability assessment.  
- Equity and access must be considered alongside efficiency.

This chapter establishes the economic assessment foundation for integrating sustainability into societal decision-making.
