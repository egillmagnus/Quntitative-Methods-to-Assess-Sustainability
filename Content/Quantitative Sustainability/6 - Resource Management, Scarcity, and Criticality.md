# Chapter 6 – Resource Management, Scarcity, and Criticality

## 1. Fundamental Concepts of Natural Resources

### 1.1 What Is a Natural Resource?

Natural resources are elements of the environment that humans use to support economic activity, well-being, and development. A primary way to classify natural resources is based on **renewability**.

---

## 2. Renewable vs. Non-Renewable Resources

### 2.1 Non-Renewable Resources

A resource is non-renewable if it **cannot regenerate within a timeframe relevant to human exploitation**.

Examples:

- Minerals  
- Oil  
- Natural gas

Although some non-renewable resources (e.g., oil) may technically regenerate over geological timescales, this regeneration is irrelevant on human timescales. Thus, from a sustainability perspective, these resources are treated as finite.

---

### 2.2 Renewable Resources

A resource is renewable if it can **harness Earth-system processes to regenerate** within a timeframe compatible with human use.

Examples:

- Soil  
- Plants  
- Animals  
- Water  
- Wind

However, renewability does **not** imply infinite availability. Human activities can reduce:

- the size of the resource stock, or  
- the resource’s ability to renew itself.

---

## 3. Types of Resource Exploitation

When exploiting natural resources, two key questions arise.

### 3.1 Extraction vs. Use of Resource-Derived Products

- **Extractive use**: Removing the resource itself (e.g., mining minerals).  
- **Use of resource-derived products**: Using outputs generated by the resource (e.g., fish, timber).

### 3.2 Consumptive vs. Non-Consumptive Use

- **Consumptive use**: Resource use reduces availability for others.  
- **Non-consumptive use**: Resource use does not reduce availability.

However, even non-extractive activities can impair renewability (e.g., pollution affecting fish stocks).

---

## 4. Exploitation Patterns of Non-Renewable Resources

The exploitation pattern of non-renewable resources is relatively straightforward:

1. Resource is discovered and adopted.  
2. Demand increases.  
3. Extraction peaks.  
4. Resource is depleted or becomes uneconomical.  
5. Society transitions to an alternative or abandons the resource.

Recycling, reuse, and reduced consumption can **extend the timeline**, but they cannot change the fundamental shape of this curve.

---

## 5. Exploitation Patterns of Renewable Resources

Renewable resources exhibit more complex dynamics. Possible trajectories include:

- **Sustainable exploitation**: Consumption rate does not exceed regeneration rate.  
- **Transition to alternatives**: Resource can recover to pre-exploitation levels.  
- **Overexploitation**: Regeneration capacity is impaired, potentially leading to population collapse or extirpation.

Thus, renewable resources can be exhausted **functionally**, even if they are renewable in principle.

---

## 6. Sustainability of Resource Exploitation

Whether exploitation is sustainable depends on **governance context**. Two key factors determine sustainability:

1. **Excludability**: Can some actors be prevented from accessing the resource?  
2. **Rivalry**: Does use by one actor reduce availability for others?

These two dimensions define four categories of goods.

---

## 7. Types of Resources Based on Excludability and Rivalry

### 7.1 Private Goods

- Access can be restricted.  
- Use by one actor prevents use by others.

Examples:

- Bread  
- Parking spaces  
- Private land (e.g., a fenced field)

---

### 7.2 Club Goods

- Access can be restricted.  
- Use by one actor does **not** significantly reduce use by others.

Examples:

- Cinemas  
- Membership-based services  
- Private nature parks

---

### 7.3 Public Goods

- Access cannot be restricted.  
- Use by one actor does **not** prevent use by others.

Examples:

- Knowledge  
- Street lighting  
- Public parks (under low congestion)

---

### 7.4 Common Goods (Common-Pool Resources)

- Access cannot be restricted.  
- Use by one actor **does** reduce availability for others.

Examples:

- Fish stocks  
- Groundwater  
- Public parks when degradation occurs

Common goods are particularly challenging to manage sustainably.

---

## 8. Why Common Goods Are Problematic

Common goods often provide **ecosystem services**, including:

- Provisioning services (e.g., fish)  
- Regulating services (e.g., climate regulation)  
- Cultural services (e.g., recreation)  
- Supporting services (e.g., nutrient cycling)

Traditional resource management often focuses only on extraction, neglecting broader ecosystem services. Human activities can impose pressures far beyond the location of use (e.g., climate change, air pollution, biodiversity loss).

---

## 9. The Tragedy of the Commons

### 9.1 Concept

The tragedy of the commons occurs when:

- Multiple actors exploit a shared resource.  
- Each actor benefits individually from increased use.  
- The costs of overuse are shared collectively.

This creates incentives to overexploit.

---

### 9.2 Example: Fisheries

- Multiple countries exploit the same fish stock.  
- Increasing fishing effort benefits the individual country.  
- Stock depletion costs are shared by all.  
- Exclusion is difficult or impossible.

Without intervention, it is always rational to defect, leading to overexploitation and eventual collapse.

---

## 10. Game-Theoretic Interpretation

The tragedy of the commons resembles a **prisoner’s dilemma**.

### 10.1 Nash Equilibrium

A Nash equilibrium is defined as:

> A situation where no player can improve their outcome by  
> unilaterally changing strategy, given the strategy of others.

In common-resource exploitation:

- Individual rational behavior leads to collective irrational outcomes.  
- Actors cannot control the behavior of others.  
- Cooperation is unstable without governance mechanisms.

---

## 11. Governance Solutions to the Commons Problem

### 11.1 Assigning Property Rights

- Convert common goods into private or club goods.  
- Example: fishing quotas.

### 11.2 Collective Governance

- Regional or international agreements.  
- Example: European common policies.

However, governance failures are common, and enforcement is difficult.

---

## 12. Can Common Goods Be Managed Sustainably?

Yes — but it is challenging. Sustainable management requires:

- effective governance,  
- monitoring and enforcement,  
- cooperation among actors,  
- consideration of ecosystem services beyond extraction.

---

## 13. Key Conclusions

- Renewable resources do not necessarily become exhausted, but they can be functionally depleted.  
- Sustainability depends on both ecological dynamics and governance structures.  
- Excludability and rivalry determine management feasibility.  
- Common goods are particularly difficult to manage sustainably.  
- Many critical ecosystem services fall into the category of common goods.

---

## 14. Summary

- Natural resources can be renewable or non-renewable.  
- Exploitation patterns differ fundamentally between these categories.  
- Governance context is central to sustainability.  
- The tragedy of the commons explains why unregulated shared resources collapse.  
- Sustainable resource management requires institutional solutions, not only technological ones.
